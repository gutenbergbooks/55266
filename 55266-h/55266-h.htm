<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scientific instruments prepared by the glass-blower
are numerous and highly useful: barometers,
thermometers, syphons, and many other
vessels constructed of tubes, are indispensable to
the student of physics or chemistry. Some of these
instruments are high in price, and liable to frequent
destruction; and those by whom they are much
employed are subject to considerable expense in
procuring or replacing them. It is therefore advisable
that he who desires to occupy himself in the
pursuit of experimental science, should know how
to prepare such instruments himself; that, in short,
he should become his own glass-blower. “The
attainment of a ready practice in the blowing and
bending of glass,” says Mr. Faraday, “is one of
those experimental acquirements which render the
chemist most independent of large towns and of
instrument-makers.”</p>

<p>Unquestionably the best method of learning to
work glass is to obtain personal instructions from
one who is conversant with the art: but such instructions
are not easily obtained. The best operators
are not always the best teachers; and to
find a person equally qualified and willing to teach
the art, is a matter of considerable difficulty. In
large towns, workmen are too much engaged with
their ordinary business to step aside for such a
purpose; and in small towns glass-blowers are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
seldom to be found. In most cases, also, they are
too jealous of their supposed <i>secrets</i> to be willing
to communicate their methods of operating to
strangers, even when paid to do so.</p>

<p>The following Treatise is a free translation of
<i>L’Art du Souffleur à la Lampe, par</i> <span class="smcap">T. P.
Danger</span>. The author is employed, in Paris, in
preparing glass instruments for sale, and in teaching
others the art of preparing them. He has presented
in this work the most minute instructions
for the working of glass which have ever been
offered to the public. The general processes of
the art are so fully explained, and the experimental
illustrations are so numerous, that nothing remains
except the reducing of these instructions to practice
to enable the student to become an adept in
the blowing of glass. I trust that, in publishing
this work in an English dress, I may be considered
as aiding in some degree the progress of physical
science.</p>

<p>This work contains a description of a cheap blowpipe
and a very convenient lamp; both of them
the invention of the author: but any other kind
of lamp or blowpipe may be employed instead of
these. The reader who wishes for a description of
the blowpipes generally employed in England, may
consult Mr. <span class="smcap">Griffin’s</span> <i>Practical Treatise on the
Use of the Blowpipe in Chemical and Mineral
Analysis</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The flame of a lamp, or candle, condensed and
directed by a current of air, is exceedingly useful
in a great number of arts. The instrument which
is employed to modify flame is the <span class="smcap">Blowpipe</span>. This
is an indispensable agent for jewellers, watch-makers,
enamellers, glass-blowers, natural philosophers,
chemists, mineralogists, and, indeed, for all
persons who are occupied with the sciences, or
their application to the arts. Its employment
offers immense advantages in a multitude of circumstances;
and the best method of making use
of so powerful an agent ought to be well known to
every person who is likely to be called upon to
adopt it.</p>

<p>Students, especially those who desire to exercise
themselves in chemical manipulation, must feel the
want of a simple and economical process, by means
of which they could give to glass tubes, of which
they make great use, the various forms that are
necessary for particular operations. How much
reason have they to complain of the high price of
the instruments of which they make continual use!
The studies of a great number are shackled from
want of opportunity to exercise themselves in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
manipulation; and many, not daring to be at the
expense of a machine of which they doubt their
ability to make an advantageous use, figure to
themselves the employment of the glass-blower’s
apparatus as being beset with difficulties, and so
rest without having even an idea of the numberless
instruments which can be made by its means.</p>

<p>Many persons would very willingly occupy
their leisure time in practising the charming art of
working glass and enamels with the blowpipe;
but the anticipated expense of the apparatus, and
the difficulties which they imagine to foresee in the
execution of work of this kind, always repels them.</p>

<p>The new species of blowpipe which we have
offered to the public, and which has received the
approbation of the Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, obviates all these inconveniences: its
moderate price, its portability, and the facility
with which it can be used, adapt it to general
employment.</p>

<p>But we should not believe that we had attained
the end which we had proposed to ourselves if we
had not placed young students in a situation to
repeat at their own houses, at little cost, and with
the greatest facility, the experiments which are
necessary to familiarise them with the sciences.
It is with such a view that we present to them this
little Treatise, which is destined to teach them the
simplest, the most expeditious, the least expensive,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
and the most effectual methods of constructing
themselves the various instruments which they require
in the prosecution of their studies.</p>

<p>The word <i>glass-blower</i>, generally speaking,
signifies a workman who occupies himself in
making of glass and enamel, the instruments,
vessels, and ornaments, which are fabricated on a
larger scale in the glass-houses: but the domain of
the sciences having laid the art of glass-blowing
under contribution, the artists of the lamp have
divided the labours thereof. Some apply themselves
particularly to the construction of philosophical
and chemical instruments; others occupy
themselves with little ornamental objects, such as
flowers, &amp;c.; and, among the latter, some manufacture
nothing but pearls, and others only artificial
eyes. Finally, a few artists confine themselves
to drawing and painting on enamel, which substance
is previously applied to metallic surfaces
by means of the fire of a muffle.</p>

<p>As we intend to treat separately of these different
branches of the art, we commence with that
of which the manipulation is the simplest.</p>

<h2><small>THE</small><br />

<span class="xx-large">ART OF GLASS-BLOWING.</span><br />

<img class="figcenter" src="images/hr.jpg" alt="" />

<span id="I">I.&mdash;<i>Instruments employed in Glass-Blowing.</i></span></h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On seeing, for the first time, a glass-blower at
work, we are astonished at the multitude and
the variety of the modifications to which he can
make the glass submit. The small number and
the simplicity of the instruments he employs, is
also surprising. The blowpipe, or, in its place,
the glass-blower’s bellows and a lamp, are indeed
all that are indispensable.</p>

<h3 id="THE_BLOWPIPE">THE BLOWPIPE.</h3>

<p>Originally, the blowpipe was only a simple,
conical tube, more or less curved towards its point,
and terminated by a very small circular opening.
By means of this, a current of air was carried
against the flame of a candle, and the inflamed
matter was directed upon small objects, of
which it was desirable to elevate the temperature.
Workers in metal still derive immense
advantages from the use of this little instrument:
they employ it in the soldering of very small
articles, as well as for heating the extremities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
of delicate tools, in order to temper them.
But since the blowpipe has passed into the
hands of mineralogical chemists, its form has
been subjected to a series of very curious and
important modifications. In spite, however,
of these ameliorations, which rendered the instrument
better adapted for the uses to which
it was successively applied, we are far from
having drawn from it all the advantages to
which we might attain, were its employment
not as fatiguing as it is difficult. We require
no other proof of this than the small number
of those who know well how to make use of
the blowpipe.</p>

<p>The most economical blowpipe is a tube of
glass, bent near one end, and pointed at its
extremity. A bulb is blown near that part of
the tube which corresponds with the curvature
(<a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 7.) This bulb serves as a reservoir
for moisture deposited by the air blown into
the tube from the mouth. If you employ a
tube without a bulb, the moisture is projected
in drops into the flame, and upon the objects
heated by it&mdash;an effect which is very inconvenient
in practice. To put this instrument
into action, accustom yourself to hold the mouth
full of air, and to keep the cheeks well inflated,
during a pretty long series of alternate inspirations
and expirations; then, seizing lightly
with the lips the mouth of the blowpipe, suffer
the air compressed by the muscles of the cheeks,
which act the part of a bellows, to escape by
the beak of the blowpipe, which you will be
able to do without being put to the least inconvenience
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
with regard to respiration. When
the air contained in the mouth is pretty nearly
expended, you must take advantage of an inspiration,
to inflate the lungs afresh; and thus
the operation is continued. You must never
blow through the tube by means of the lungs;
first, because air which has been in the lungs
is less proper for combustion than that which
has merely passed through the nose and mouth;
secondly, because the effort which it would be
necessary to make, to sustain the blast for only
a short time, would by its frequent repetition
become very injurious to your health.</p>

<p>The jet of flame produced by the mouth-blowpipe
can only be used to heat small objects:
when instruments of a considerable bulk
have to be worked, it is customary to employ
the <i>lamp</i>, or <i>glass-blower’s table</i>.</p>

<h3 id="THE_GLASS_BLOWERS_TABLE">THE GLASS-BLOWER’S TABLE.</h3>

<p>Artists give this name to an apparatus which
consists of the following articles:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A <i>Table</i>, below which is disposed a
<i>double bellows</i>, capable of being put in motion
by means of a pedal. This bellows furnishes a
continued current of air, which can be directed
at pleasure by making it pass through a tube
terminating above the table in a sharp beak.
The bellows with which the glass-blower’s
tables are commonly furnished have very great
defects. The irregular form which is given to
the pannels diminishes the capacity of the instruments,
without augmenting their advantages.
If we reflect an instant on the angle, more or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
less open, which these pannels form when in
motion, we instantly perceive that the weight
with which the upper surface of a bellows is
charged, and which always affords a vertical
pressure, acts very unequally on the arm of a
lever which is continually changing its position.
This faulty disposition of the parts of the machine
has the effect of varying every instant
the intensity of the current of air directed upon
the flame. All these inconveniences would disappear,
were the upper pannel, like that in the
middle, disposed in such a manner as to be
always horizontal. It ought to be elevated and
depressed, in its whole extent, in the same manner;
so that, when charged with a weight, the
pressure should be constantly the same, and the
current of air uniform.</p>

<p>2. A <i>lamp</i>, of copper or tin plate.&mdash;The
construction of this article, sufficiently imperfect
until the present time, has varied according to
the taste of those who have made use of it.
We shall give, farther on, the description of a
lamp altogether novel in its construction.</p>

<p>3. The glass-blower’s table is generally furnished
with little <i>drawers</i> for holding the tools
employed in modelling the softened glass.
Careful artists have the surface of their table
coated with sheet iron, in order that it may not
be burned by the hot substances that fall, or
are laid upon it. As glass-blowers have frequent
occasion to take measures, it is convenient
to have the front edge of the table divided into
a certain number of equal parts, marked with
copper nails. This enables the workman to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
take, at a glance of the eye, the half, third, or
fourth of a tube, or to give the same length to
articles of the same kind, without having perpetual
recourse to the rule and compasses. But
when it is desirable to have the tubes, or the
work, measured with <i>greater exactness</i> than it
can be measured by this method, the rule and
the compasses can be applied to.</p>

<h3 id="THE_EOLIPYLE">THE EOLIPYLE.</h3>

<p>We shall merely make mention of this instrument.
It is a globular vessel, commonly
formed of brass. If filled with a very combustible
liquor, such as alcohol, and strongly
heated, it affords a rapid current of vapour,
which, if directed by means of a fine beak into
the middle of a flame, produces the same effect
as the air which issues from a blowpipe. The
eolipyle is a pretty toy, but not a good instrument
for a workman, its action being too
irregular.</p>

<h3 id="BLOWPIPE_WITH_CONTINUED_CURRENT">BLOWPIPE WITH CONTINUED CURRENT.</h3>

<p>It is after having, during a long period, made
use of the instruments of which we have spoken,
and fully experienced their inconveniences,
that, aware of the indispensable necessity for
such instruments in the arts and sciences, we
have thought it our duty to make known to the
public <i>a New Apparatus</i>, which is, not only
calculated to fulfil the same purposes, but
presents advantages which it is easy to appreciate.
The price of it is only the sixth part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
that of the glass-blower’s table<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>. It is very
portable, and capable of being attached to any
table whatever. It unites the advantages of
not fatiguing the workman, of leaving his hands
free, and of rendering him absolute master of
the current of air, which he can direct on the
flame either of the lamp or the candle,&mdash;advantages
which are not offered in the same degree
even by the table of the glass-blower.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
In Paris, the blowpipe which is here described is
sold for six francs (five shillings English); or, with the
improved lamp and candlestick, twelve francs.</p></div>

<p>The instrument which we have presented is,
properly speaking, nothing but a simple blowpipe,
C, (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 19) communicating with a
bladder, or leather bag, fixed on E, which is
kept full of air by means of a bent tube, D,
through which the operator blows occasionally
with the mouth. This tube is closed at its inferior
extremity, F, by a valve, which permits
the passage of air into the reservoir, but not of
its return, so that the air can only escape by
the beak of the blowpipe.</p>

<p>The valve at F is constructed in the following
manner:&mdash;At about two inches from the
end of the tube a contraction is made, as represented
at <i>a</i>, <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 24. This reduces the
internal diameter of the tube about one-third.
A small conical piece of cork or wood is now
introduced into the tube in the manner represented
by <i>c</i>. The base of the cone must be
large enough to close the tube at the point where
it is contracted; it must, however, not be so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
large as to close the tube at the wide part. A
brass pin is inserted in the point of the cone, as
is shewn in the figure. Between the cone and
the end of the tube, the piece of wood, <i>b</i>, is
fixed; the shape of this piece of wood is best
shewn by figure 25, on the same plate. There
is a hole in the centre, in which the pin of the
cork cone can move easily. The cone or valve
is therefore at liberty to move between the contraction
<i>a</i>, and the fixture <i>b</i>. Consequently,
when air is blown into the tube at <i>e</i>, the valve is
forced from the contraction, falls into the position
indicated by the dotted lines <i>d</i>, and allows
the air to pass by its sides. When, on the
contrary, the operator ceases to blow, the valve
is acted upon by the air in the bladder, which,
pressing back at <i>f</i>, drives the valve close
against the contraction, and effectually closes
the aperture. A slight hissing is heard, but
when the contraction is well made, and the
cork is good, an extremely small quantity of
air escapes.</p>

<p>The workman, seated before the table where
he has fixed his instrument, blows from time to
time, to feed the reservoir or bladder, which,
being pressed by a system of strings stretched
by a weight, produces an uniform current of
air. The force of this current of air can be
modified at pleasure, by pressing the reservoir
more or less between the knees. (Fig. 22 represents
a blowpipe complete, formed not of
glass, but of brass tubes. Fig. 22, <i>bis</i>, represents
the bladder or reservoir appertaining to
this blowpipe.)

<p><span class="smcap">M. Gaultier de Claubry</span>, who was charged
by the Committee of Chemical Arts of the
Society of Encouragement (of Paris) to make
a report on this instrument, was astonished at
the facility with which the author, in his presence,
reduced the oxide of cobalt to the metallic
state, and fused the metal to a globule; an
experiment which even M. Berzelius could not
perform with the simple blowpipe, since he
expressly says, in his work on that instrument,
that oxide of cobalt suffers no change when
heated before the blowpipe. The results obtained
with cast iron, oxide of tin, &amp;c.&mdash;experiments
which are exhibited every day at the
public lectures given by the author&mdash;evidently
prove the superiority of this apparatus over all
the blowpipes that have hitherto been contrived.</p>

<p>A detailed account of the glass tubes belonging
to this improved blowpipe will be found in the
fourth part of this work, at the article <i>Blowpipe</i>.</p>

<h3 id="THE_LAMP">THE LAMP.</h3>

<p>While occupied in rendering popular, if we
may so speak, the use of the <i>blowpipe</i>&mdash;an instrument
which is so advantageous in a great
number of circumstances&mdash;we have also endeavoured
to improve <i>the lamp</i>, which has,
until the present time, been used by all those
who employ the glass-blower’s table. The
lamp which we recommend (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 23) is of
a very simple construction. It possesses the
advantages of giving much less smoke than
the old lamp, and of being cleaned with the
greatest facility. It also gives sensibly more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
heat; because the portion of flame which, in
the common lamps, rises perpendicularly, and
is not used, is, in this case, beaten down by a
cap or hood, and made to contribute to the
force of the jet. This cap also keeps the flame
from injuring the eyes of the operator, and
destroys the smoke to such an extent, that the
large hoods with which glass-blowers commonly
garnish their work table, to carry off the smoke,
become unnecessary. This is a peculiar advantage
in the chamber of a student, where a
large hood or chimney can seldom be conveniently
prepared.</p>

<h3 id="THE_CANDLESTICK">THE CANDLESTICK.</h3>

<p>For mineralogical researches, chemical assays,
and the soldering of small objects, as in jewellery,
we recommend the use of a little candlestick,
which, by means of a spring fixed to the
bottom, maintains the candle always at the
same height. A reservoir, or shallow cup,
formed at the top of the candlestick, to hinder
the running away of the tallow or wax, allows
the operator to consume the fragments of tallow
or grease which are ordinarily lost in domestic
economy. There is a little hole in the centre
of the cup or upper part of the candlestick,
through which the wick of the candle passes.
<i>o</i>, <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 22, is a representation of this
candlestick.</p>

<h3 id="COMBUSTIBLES">COMBUSTIBLES.</h3>

<p><i id="OIL_TALLOW">Oil</i>, <i>Tallow</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;Among the substances
which have been employed to feed the fire of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the glass-blower’s lamp, those to which the
preference is to be given are wax, olive oil,
rape oil, poppy oil, and tallow. Animal oils,
such as bone oil and fish oil, are much esteemed
by some glass-blowers, who pretend that with
these substances they obtain better results than
with other combustibles. Nevertheless, animal
oils, generally speaking, do not give so much
heat as purified rape oil, while they exhale an
odour which is extremely disagreeable.</p>

<p>As to alcohol, which is sometimes used with
the eolipyle, its combustion furnishes so feeble
a degree of heat that its employment cannot be
recommended.</p>

<p>Purified rape oil is that of which the use is
the most general. Next to olive oil and wax,
it affords the greatest heat, and the least smoke.
But, in a word, as in the working of glass, the
operator has more need of a bright flame without
smoke, than of a high temperature, any
combustible may be employed which is capable
of furnishing a flame possessing these two
qualities. The vegetable oils thicken, and
suffer alterations more or less sensible, when
they are long exposed to the action of the air.
They should be chosen very limpid, and they
may be preserved in that state by being enclosed
in bottles, which should be kept quite full and
well corked.</p>

<p id="THE_WICKS"><i>The Wicks.</i>&mdash;There has never been any
substance so generally used for wicks as
cotton; some glass-blowers, indeed, have employed
wicks of asbestus, but without deriving
from them the advantages which might have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
been expected; the greater number, therefore,
keep to cotton.</p>

<p>But it has been observed that cotton which
has been for some time exposed to the air no
longer possesses the good properties for which
glass-blowers esteem it. The alteration of the
cotton is probably brought about by the dust
and water which the air always holds in suspension.
Such cotton burns badly, forms a
bulky coal, and permits with much difficulty
the capillary ascension of the liquid which
serves to support the flame; so that it is impossible
to obtain a good fire, and necessary to be
incessantly occupied in snuffing the wick.
Cotton is equally subject to alteration when
lying in the lamp, even though impregnated
with oil. You should avoid making use of
wicks that are too old. When you foresee
that you will remain a long time without having
occasion to employ the lamp, pour the oil into
a bottle, which can be corked up, and let the
wick be destroyed, previously squeezing from
it the oil which it contains.</p>

<p>It is indispensable to make use of none but
new and good cotton; it should be clean, soft,
fine, and not twisted. It is best to preserve it
in boxes, after having folded it in many double
papers, to exclude dust and moisture. When
you wish to make wicks, take a skein of cotton
and cut it into four or six pieces, dispose them
side by side in such a manner as to make a
bundle, more or less thick, and eight or ten
inches in length; pass a large comb lightly
through the bundle, to lay the threads even, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
tie it gently at each end, to keep the threads
from getting entangled.</p>

<p id="RELATION_BETWEEN_THE_DIAMETER"><i>Relation between the diameters of the
beaks of the blowpipe, and the wicks of the
lamp.</i>&mdash;We believe that we cannot place
better than here a few observations respecting
the size of the opening in the beak of the blowpipe,
considered in relation to the size of the
wick of the lamp. These observations will
probably be superfluous to those who are
already conversant with the use of the blowpipe;
but as every thing is interesting to beginners,
who are frequently stopped in their progress by
very slight difficulties, and as this Treatise is
particularly designed for beginners, we do not
hesitate to enter into the minutest details on
subjects which we deem interesting.</p>

<p>The point of your blowpipe should be formed
in such a manner, that you can fix upon it
various little beaks or caps, the orifices in
which, always perfectly round, ought to vary in
size according to the bulk of the flame upon
which you desire to act. You cannot, without
this precaution, obtain the maximum of heat
which the combustion of the oil is capable of
affording. This employment of little moveable
caps offers the facility of establishing a current
of air, greater or smaller, according to the object
you wish to effect; above all, it allows you
to clean with ease the cavity or orifice of the
beak, as often as it may be necessary.</p>

<p>These caps can be made of different materials.
It is most advisable to have them made of
copper or brass; those which are formed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
tin plate (white iron), and which are commonly
used in chemical laboratories, are the worst
kind of all. They soon become covered with
grease or soot, which either completely closes
up the orifices, or, at least, very soon alters the
circular form which is necessary to the production
of a good fire. Glass caps are less liable
to get dirty, and are much cheaper than the
above; but, on the other hand, they have the
disadvantage of being easily melted. This
can to a certain extent be remedied by making
the points of very thick glass, and by always
keeping them at some distance from the flame.
Moreover, as you can make them yourself when
you are at leisure, their use is very commodious.
If they are to be used with the blowpipe described
in this work, they must be fixed in the
cork that closes the passage through which the
current of air arrives. <i>C c</i> and <i>C´ c</i> (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>,
fig. 19) are two glass beaks, <i>c c</i> are the
corks, which can indifferently be adapted to <i>c</i>,
in the wooden vice, by which the various parts
of the blowpipe are connected when it is in
action.</p>

<p>Of whatever material the beak may be made,
its orifice must be perfectly round, and the
<i>size</i> of the orifice, as we have before observed,
must have a relation to the size of the wick
which is to be used with it. You can ascertain
the diameters of the orifices by inserting
into them a little plate of brass, having the
form of a long isoceles triangle, such as is represented
by <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 2. It should be an inch
long, the twelfth of an inch wide at one end,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and diminish to nothing at the other. When
divided into eight equal parts, it will give, at the
divisions, the respective proportions of 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7 <i>eighths</i> of the diameter at the wide
end, as is exemplified by the figure above
referred to. We have stated in the following
table the relative diameters which long experience
has recommended to us, as being adapted
to produce the greatest effect; yet it is not to
be imagined that these proportions are mathematically
correct and indispensable for the obtaining
of good results. A sensible difference
of effect would be perceived, however, were
these proportions departed from in a notable
manner.</p>

<p>It must be mentioned, that this table has been
formed from experiments made with a glass-blower’s
lamp of the ordinary construction; so
that, with the new lamp with the hood, described
in this work, it will not be necessary to
employ wicks of so great a bulk, nor yet to
elevate them so much above the level of the oil,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in order to produce the same effect. Hence
there will be a very considerable saving in oil.</p>

<p>The wicks of a quarter of an inch in diameter
are only adapted for mineralogieal examinations,
for soldering very fine metallic substances, and
for working very small tubes. When the objects
are of considerable bulk, it is in general
necessary to have a flame sufficiently large to
cover the whole instrument, or at least all the
portion of the instrument which is operated upon
at once. For working tubes, of which the sides
are not more than the twelfth of an inch in
thickness, you should have a wick at least as
wide as the tube that is worked upon. The
diameter of the lamp-wick usually employed is
<i>one inch</i>; a wick of this size is sufficient for
all the glass instruments which are in common
use.

<h3 id="THE_FLAME">THE FLAME.</h3>

<p>It is only by long habitude, and a species of
routine, that workmen come to know, not only
the kind of flame which is most proper for each
object they wish to make, but the exact point of
the jet where they ought to expose their glass.
By analysing the flame, upon the knowledge of
which depends the success of the work, we can
immediately obtain results, which, without that,
could only be the fruit of long experience.</p>

<p>Flame is a gaseous matter, of which a portion
is heated to the point of becoming luminous;
its form depends upon the mode of its
disengagement, and upon the force and direction
of the current of air which either supports
its combustion or acts upon it mechanically.
(<a href="#pl_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 1.)</p>

<p>The flame of a candle, burning freely in still
air, presents in general the form of a pyramid,
of which the base is supported on a hemisphere.
It consists of four distinct parts: the immediate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
products of the decomposition of the combustible
by the heat which is produced, occupy
the centre, <i>o</i>, where they exist in the state of
an obscure gaseous matter, circumscribed by a
brilliant and very luminous envelope, <i>s</i>; the
latter is nothing but the obscure matter itself,
in the circumstances where, on coming into
contact with the atmosphere, it combines with
the oxygen which exists therein, and forms
what is properly called <i>flame</i>.</p>

<p>The blueish light which characterises the inferior
part of the flame, <i>s</i>, is produced by a
current of cold air, which, passing from below
<i>upwards</i>, hinders the combustion from taking
place at the bottom of the flame, at the <i>same</i>
temperature that exists in the parts of the flame
not immediately subject to this influence.</p>

<p>Finally, on observing attentively, we perceive
a fourth part, which is but slightly luminous,
and exists as an envelope of all the
other parts of the flame. The greatest thickness
of this envelope corresponds with the
summit of the flame. From this point it gradually
becomes thinner, till it arrives at the
lowest part of the blueish light, where it altogether
disappears. It is in this last-described
portion of the flame that the combustion of the
gas is finished, and there it is that we find the
seat of the most intense heat which the flame
of the candle affords. If we compare the temperature
of the different parts of the flame, we
find that the <i>maximum</i> of heat forms a ring
corresponding to the zone of insertion, A A;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
a point which is the limit of the superior extremity
of the blueish light.</p>

<p>When the flame is acted upon by the blowpipe,
it is subject to two principal modifications:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. If, by means of a blowpipe with a very
fine orifice, you direct a current of air through
the middle of the flame, you project a portion
of the flame in the direction of the blast. The
jet thus formed appears like a tongue of fire,
blueish, cylindrical, straight, and very long;
the current of air occupies its interior. This
flame is enveloped on all sides by an almost invisible
light, which, extending beyond the blue
flame, forms a jet, A´ B, very little luminous,
but possessing an extremely high temperature.
It is at the point A´, which corresponds with
the extremity of the blue flame, that the <i>maximum</i>
of heat is found. The extreme point of
the jet B possesses a less degree of heat. This
flame is adapted for mineralogical assays, for
soldering, for working enamels, and in general
for all small objects.</p>

<p>2. When the orifice of the blowpipe is
somewhat large, or when (the orifice being capillary)
the current of air is very strong, or the
beak is somewhat removed from the flame, the
jet of fire, instead of being prolonged into a
pointed tongue, is blown into a brush. It
makes then a roaring noise, and spreads into
an irregular figure, wherein the different parts
of the flame are confounded beyond the possibility
of discrimination. This flame is very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
proper for the working of glass, and particularly
of glass tubes; it ought to be clear and
very brilliant, and above all should not deposit
soot upon cold bodies suddenly plunged into
it. The <i>maximum</i> of temperature in this flame
is not well marked; we can say, however, that
in general it will be found at about two-thirds
of the whole length of the jet. As this roaring
flame contains a great quantity of carburetted
hydrogen, and even of vapour of oil, escaped
from combustion, it possesses a disoxidizing
or reducing property in a very high degree.</p>

<h3 id="PLACES_FIT_TO_WORK_IN">PLACES FIT TO WORK IN.</h3>

<p>Every place is adapted for a workshop, provided
it is not too light and the air is tranquil.
The light of the lamp enables one to work with
more safety than day-light, which does not permit
the dull-red colour of hot glass to be seen.
Currents of cold air are to be avoided, because
they occasion the fracture of glass exposed to
them on coming out of the flame.</p>

<h3 id="MEANS_OF_OBTAINING_A_GOOD_FIRE">MEANS OF OBTAINING A GOOD FIRE.</h3>

<p>The lamp should be firmly seated upon a
steady and perfectly horizontal table, and
should be kept continually full of oil. The oil
which escapes during the operation, from the
lamp into the tin-stand placed below it, should
be taken up with a glass tube having a large
bulb, and returned to the lamp.</p>

<p>When you set to work, the first thing you
have to do is to examine the orifice of the beak.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
If it is closed, or altered in form, by adhering
soot, you must carefully clean it, and open the
canal by means of a needle or fine wire. In
the next place, you freshen the wick by cutting
it squarely, and carrying off with the scissars
the parts which are carbonised. You then
divide it into two principal bundles, such as
C, K (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 21), which you separate
sufficiently to permit a current of air, directed
between the two, to touch their surfaces lightly,
without being interrupted in its progress. By
pushing the bundles more or less close to one
another, and by snuffing them, you arrive at
length at obtaining a convenient jet. It is a
good plan to allow, between the two principal
bundles and at their inferior part, a little portion
of the wick to remain: you bend this
down in the direction of the jet, and make it lie
immediately beneath the current of air.</p>

<p>The wick must be prevented from touching
the rim of the lamp, in order to avoid the running
of the oil into the stand of the lamp. This
is easily managed by means of a bent iron-wire,
disposed as it is in the lamp described in this
work; see <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 23, where the wire is seen
in an elevated position. When the wick is in
the lamp, the wire is brought down round the
wick and level with the surface of the lamp.
A few drops of oil of turpentine, spread on the
wick, makes it take fire immediately, over its
whole extent, on the approach of an inflamed
substance.</p>

<p>To obtain a good fire, it is necessary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
place the lamp in such a position that the orifice
of the blowpipe shall just touch the exterior
part of the flame. The beak must not enter
the flame, as it can then throw into the jet only
an inconsiderable portion of the ignited matter.
See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 20. On the other hand, if the
lamp be too far away from the blowpipe, the
flame becomes trembling, appears blueish, and
possesses a very low degree of heat.</p>

<p>For mineralogical experiments, and for operations
connected with watch-making and
jewellery, the current of air should project the
flame horizontally. For glass-blowing, the
flame should be projected in the direction intimated
by the arrow in <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 20&mdash;that is to
say, under an angle of twenty or twenty-five
degrees.</p>

<p>The current of air ought to be constant,
uniform, and sufficiently powerful to carry the
flame in its direction. When it is not strong
enough to produce this effect, it is necessary
to add weights to the bellows or the bladder,
according as the glass-blowers’ table or our
lamp is employed. The point to which you
should apply, in the use of these instruments,
is to enable yourself to produce a current of
air so uniform in its course that the projected
flame be without the least variation.</p>

<p>Finally, when you leave off working you
should extinguish the flame, by cutting off the
inflamed portion of the wick with the scissars.
This has the double advantage of avoiding the
production of a mass of smoke and of leaving
the lamp in a fit state for another operation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<h3 id="CHOICE_AND_PRESERVATION_OF_GLASS">CHOICE AND PRESERVATION OF GLASS.</h3>

<p>The only materials employed in the fabrication
of the objects described in this Treatise, are
tubes of common glass or of flint-glass. They
can be had of all diameters, and of every variety
of substance. They are commonly about
three feet long, but some are found in commerce
which are six feet in length. You should choose
tubes that are very uniform&mdash;that is to say, straight
and perfectly cylindrical, both inside and outside.
A good tube should have the same diameter
from one end to the other, and the sides
or substance of the glass should be of equal
thickness in every part. This is indispensable
when the tubes are to have spherical bulbs
blown upon them. We shall describe, in the
article <i>Graduation</i>, the method of ascertaining
whether or not a tube is uniform in the bore.</p>

<p>The substance of the glass should be perfectly
clear, without bulbs, or specks, or
stripes. The tubes are so much the more easy
of use, as the glass of which they are made is
the more homogeneous. Under this point of
view, the white glass, known in commerce by
the name of crystal or flint-glass, is preferable
to common glass: it is more fusible, less fragile,
and less liable to break under the alternations
of heat and cold; but it is dearer and
heavier, and has the serious disadvantage of
becoming permanently black when exposed to
a certain part of the flame. This is an effect,
the causes and consequences of which will be
explained in a subsequent chapter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>You must take care never to employ flint-glass
for instruments which are to be submitted to
the action of certain fluids&mdash;such as sulphuretted
and phosphuretted hydrogen, and the hydro-sulphurets;
for these compounds are capable
of decomposing flint-glass, in consequence of
its containing oxide of lead. In general, hard
common glass is preferable to flint-glass for all
instruments which are to be employed in chemistry.
Flint-glass should only be used for
ornamental objects, and for the barometers,
thermometers, and other instruments employed
in philosophical researches.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that glass tubes lose
their transparence and ductility, and suddenly
become almost infusible, in the fire of the lamp:
this effect takes place when they have been
kept for some time in a melted state. It is
then almost impossible to bring them back to
their original condition; it can only be done
by exposing them for a long time to an exceedingly
high temperature. You can prevent this
accident by working such kind of glass with
considerable rapidity, and in a pretty brisk
fire. There are tubes, however, which vitrify
so promptly that it is only a person well versed
in the art who can make good use of them.
It is best not to employ such glass. But how
can it be discriminated before-hand? It is experience,
sooner than any characters capable
of description, that will teach you how to
make choice of good glass; nevertheless we
have observed, that, among the glass tubes
which occur in commerce, those possessing a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
very <i>white colour</i> manifest this bad quality
most particularly. It may be observed, that,
for tubes which are to have thin sides, this
vitrifiable sort of glass is better than any other.</p>

<p>For certain philosophical instruments it is
necessary to employ flat tubes. These are
formed of flint-glass, are very small, and have
a canal or bore, which, instead of being round,
as in common tubes, has the form of a long and
very flat oval. This disposition has the advantage
of rendering more perceptible the column
of liquid that may be introduced, and
which in a round canal would scarcely be visible.
In choosing this sort of tubes, carefully
avoid those of which the canal is twisted, and
not found to be in the same plane, in the whole
length of the tube.</p>

<p>The tubes should be sorted, according to
their sizes and qualities, and should be deposited
in large drawers or on long shelves, in
such a manner as to be equally supported
through their whole extent. They should also
be sheltered from dust and from moisture. If
you cannot conveniently warehouse them in
this manner, you should tie them up in parcels,
and support them in a perpendicular position.
It is a very bad plan to place them in an inclined
direction, or to support them by their
extremities on wooden brackets, as it is the
fashion to do in chemical laboratories; because,
as the tubes are then supported only at certain
points, they bend, in course of time, under
the influence of their own weight, and contract
a curvature which is extremely prejudicial in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
certain instruments, and which it is almost impossible
to correct.</p>

<h3 id="PREPARATION_OF_GLASS_TUBES_BEFORE_HEATING_THEM">PREPARATION OF TUBES BEFORE HEATING THEM.</h3>

<p>Before presenting a tube to the flame, you
should clean it well both within and without,
in order to remove all dust and humidity. If
you neglect to take this precaution, you run
the risk of cracking or staining the glass.
When the diameter of the tube is too small to
permit of your passing a plug of cloth or paper
to clean its interior, you can accomplish the object
by the introduction of water, which must,
many times alternately, be sucked in and
blown out, until the tube is deemed clean.
One end of it must then be closed at the lamp,
and it must be gradually exposed to a charcoal
fire, where, by raising successively all parts of
the tube to a sufficiently high temperature, you
endeavour to volatilize and expel all the water
it contains. In all cases you considerably facilitate
the disengagement of moisture by renewing
the air in the tube by means of a bottle of
Indian-rubber fastened to the end of a long narrow
tube, which you keep in the interior of
the tube to be dried during the time that it is
being heated. You can here advantageously
substitute alcohol for water, as being much
more volatile, and as dissolving greasy matters;
but these methods of cleansing should only be
employed for valuable objects, because it is
extremely difficult fully to expel moisture from
a tube wherein you have introduced water,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and because alcohol is too expensive to be employed
where there is no particular necessity.</p>

<p>When the tubes no longer contain dust, or
moisture, you measure them, and mark the
divisions according to the sort of work which
you propose to execute.</p>

<h3 id="METHOD_OF_PRESENTING_TUBES_TO_THE_FIRE_AND_OF_WORKING_THEM_THEREIN">METHOD OF PRESENTING TUBES TO THE FIRE, AND OF WORKING THEM THEREIN.</h3>

<p>The two arms are supported on the front
edge of the table, and the tube is held with the
hands either above or below, according as it
may be necessary to employ more or less force,
more or less lightness. You ought, in general,
to hold the tube <i>horizontally</i>, and in such a
manner that its direction may be perpendicular
to that of the flame. Yet, when you wish to
heat at once a large portion of the tube, or to
soften it so that it shall sink together in a particular
manner, as in the operation of sealing,
you will find it convenient to <i>incline</i> the tube,
the direction of which, however, must always
be such as to turn the heated part continually
towards you.</p>

<p>We are about to give a general rule, upon
the observance of which we cannot too strongly
insist, as the success of almost every operation
entirely depends upon it. The rule is, <i>never to
present a tube to the flame without</i> <small>CONTINUALLY
TURNING</small> <i>it</i>; and turning it, too, with such a
degree of rapidity that every part of its circumference
may be heated and softened to the
same degree. As melted glass necessarily
tends to descend, there is no method of preventing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
a heated tube from becoming deformed
but that of continually turning it, so as to bring
the softened part very frequently uppermost.
When you heat a tube near the middle, the
movement of the two hands must be <i>uniform</i>
and <i>simultaneous</i>, or the tube will be twisted
and spoiled.</p>

<p>When the tubes have thick sides, they must
not be plunged <i>into</i> the flame until they have
previously been strongly heated. You expose
them at first to the current of hot air, at some
inches from the extremity of the jet; you keep
them there some time, taking care to turn them
continually, and then you gradually bring them
towards, and finally into, the flame. The
thicker the sides of the tubes are, the greater
precaution must be taken to elevate the temperature
gradually: this is the only means of
avoiding the fractures which occur when the
glass is too rapidly heated. Though it is
necessary to take so much care with large and
thick tubes, there are, on the contrary, some
tubes so small and so thin that the most sudden
application of the fire is insufficient to break
them. Practice soon teaches the rule which
is to be followed with regard to tubes that come
between these extremes.</p>

<p>Common glass ought to be fused at the
<i>maximum</i> point of heat; but glass that contains
oxides capable of being reduced at that
temperature (such as flint-glass) require to be
worked in that part of the flame which
possesses the highest oxidating power. If you
operate without taking this precaution, you run
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the risk of decomposing the glass. Thus, for
example, in the case of flint-glass, you may reduce
the oxide of lead, which is one of its constituents,
to the state of metallic lead. The consequence
of such a reduction is the production of a black
and opaque stain upon the work, which can only
be removed by exposing the glass, during a
very long time, to the extremity of the jet.</p>

<p>You must invariably take the greatest care
to keep the flame from passing into the interior
of the tube; for when it gets there it deposits a
greasy vapour, which is the ordinary cause of
the dirt which accumulates in instruments that
have been constructed without sufficient precaution
as to this matter.</p>

<p>In order that you may not blacken your
work, you should take care to snuff the
wick of the lamp whenever you perceive the
flame to deposit soot.</p>

<p>You can judge of the <i>consistence</i> of the
tubes under operation as much by the <i>feel</i> as by
the <i>look</i> of the glass. The degree of heat
necessary to be applied to particular tubes, depends
entirely upon the objects for which they
are destined. As soon as the glass begins to
feel soft, at a <i>brownish-red heat</i>, for example,
you are at the temperature most favourable to
good <i>bending</i>. But is it intended to <i>blow a
bulb</i>? The glass must, in this case, be completely
melted, and subjected to a full <i>reddish-white
heat</i>. We shall take care, when speaking
hereafter of the different operations to be
performed, to mention the temperature at which
<i>each</i> can be performed with most success.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>When an instrument upon which you have
been occupied is finished, you should remove it
from the flame <i>gradually</i>, taking care to <i>turn</i>
it continually, until the glass has acquired sufficient
consistence to support its own weight
without becoming deformed. Every instrument
formed thus of glass requires to undergo a
species of <i>annealing</i>, to enable it to be preserved
and employed. To give the instrument
this annealing, it is only necessary to remove it
from the flame very gradually, allowing it to
repose some time in each <i>cooler</i> place to which
you successively remove it. The thicker or the
more equal the sides of the glass, the more
carefully it requires to be annealed. No instrument
should be permitted to touch cold or
wet bodies while it is warm.

<span id="III">III.&mdash;<i>Fundamental Operations in Glass-Blowing</i>.</span></h2>

<p>All the modifications of shape and size which
can be given to tubes in the construction of various
instruments, are produced by a very small
number of dissimilar operations. We
have thought it best to unite the description of
these operations in one article, both to avoid
repetitions and to place those who are desirous
to exercise this art in a state to proceed,
without embarrassment, to the construction of
any instrument of which they may be provided
with a model or a drawing; for those who attend
properly to the instructions given here,
with respect to the fundamental operations of
glass-blowing, will need no other instructions
to enable them to succeed in the construction
of all kinds of instruments capable of being
made of tubes. These fundamental operations
can be reduced to ten, which may be named as
follows:&mdash;

</p>

<p>We proceed to give a detailed account of
these different operations.</p>

<h3 id="CUTTING">1.&mdash;<small>CUTTING.</small></h3>

<p>The different methods of cutting of glass
tubes which have been contrived, are all founded
on two principles; one of these is the
division of the surface of glass by cutting
instruments, the other the effecting of the same
object by a sudden change of temperature; and
sometimes these two principles are combined in
one process.</p>

<p>The first method consists in notching the
tube, at the point where it is to be divided, with
the edge of a file, or of a thin plate of hard
steel, or with a diamond; after which, you
press upon the two ends of the tube, as if to
enlarge the notch, or, what is better, you give
the tube a slight smart blow. This method is
sufficient for the breaking of small tubes.
Many glass-blowers habitually employ an agate,
or a common flint, which they hold in one hand,
while with the other they rub the tube over the
sharp edge of the stone, taking the precaution
of securing the tube by the help of the thumb.
For tubes of a greater diameter, you can employ
a fine iron wire stretched in a bow, or,
still better, the glass-cutters’ wheel; with either
of these, assisted by a mixture of emery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
and water, you can cut a circular trace round
a large tube, and then divide it with ease.</p>

<p>When the portion which is to be removed
from a tube is so small that you cannot easily
lay hold of it, you cut a notch with a file, and
expose the notch to the point of the blowpipe
flame: the cut then flies round the tube.</p>

<p>This brings us to the second method of cutting
tubes&mdash;a method which has been modified
in a great variety of ways. It is founded on
the property possessed by vitrified matters, of
breaking when exposed to a sudden change of
temperature. Acting upon this principle, some
artists apply to the tube, at the point where
they desire to cut it, a band of fused glass.
If the tube does not immediately separate into
two pieces, they give it a slight smart blow on
the extremity, or they drop a little water on
the heated ring. Other glass-blowers make
use of a piece of iron heated to redness, an
angle or a corner of which they apply to the
tube at the point where it is to be cut, and
then, if the fracture is not at once effected by
the action of the hot iron, they plunge the tube
suddenly into cold water.</p>

<p>The two methods here described can be
combined. After having made a notch with a
file, or the edge of a flint, you introduce into
it a little water, and bring close upon it the
point of a very little tube previously heated to
the melting point. This double application of
heat and moisture obliges the notch to fly right
round the tube.</p>

<p>When the object to be cut has a large diameter,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
and very thin sides&mdash;when it is such a
vessel as a drinking-glass, a cup, or a gas
tube&mdash;you may divide it with much neatness by
proceeding as follows. After having well
cleaned the vessel, both within and without,
pour oil into it till it rises to the point, or very
nearly to the point, where you desire to cut it.
Place the vessel, so prepared, in an airy situation;
then take a rod of iron, of about an inch
in diameter, make the extremity brightly red-hot,
and plunge it into the vessel until the extremity
of the iron is half an inch below the
surface of the oil: there is immediately formed
a great quantity of very hot oil, which assembles
in a thin stratum at the surface of the
cold oil, and forms a circular crack where it
touches the sides of the glass. If you take
care to place the object in a horizontal position,
and to plunge the hot iron without communicating
much agitation to the oil, the parts so
separated will be as neat and as uniform as you
could desire them to be. By means of this
method we have always perfectly succeeded in
cutting very regular zones from ordinary glass.</p>

<p>The method which is described in some
works, of cutting a tube by twisting round it
a thread saturated with oil of turpentine, and
then inflaming the thread, we have found to be
unfit for objects which have thick sides.</p>

<p>Some persons employ cotton wicks dipped in
sulphur. By the burning of these, the glass is
strongly heated in a given line, or very narrow
space, which is instantly cooled by a wet feather
or a wet stick. So soon as a crack is produced,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
it can be led in any required direction
by a red-hot iron, or an inflamed piece of charcoal.</p>

<p>Finally, you may cut small portions from
glass tubes in a state of fusion, by means of
common scissars.</p>

<h3 id="BORDERING">2.&mdash;<small>BORDERING.</small></h3>

<p>To whatever use you may destine the tubes
which you cut, they ought, almost always, to
be bordered. If you merely desire that the
edges shall not be sharp, you can smoothen
them with the file, or, what is better, you can
expose them to the flame of the lamp until they
are rounded. If you fear the sinking in of the
edges when they are in a softened state, you
can hinder this by working in the interior of
the tube a round rod of iron, such as <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>,
fig. 5. The rod of iron should be one-sixth of
an inch thick; one end of it should be filed
to a conical point, and the other end be inserted
into a thin, round, wooden handle. You
will find it convenient to have a similar rod
with a slight bend in the middle.</p>

<p>When you desire to make the edges of the
tube project, bring the end to a soft state, then
insert in it a metallic rod, and move it about in
such a manner as to widen a little the opening.
While the end of the tube is still soft, place it
suddenly upon a horizontal surface, or press it
by means of a very flat metallic plate. The object
of this operation is to make the end of the
tube flat and uniform. The metallic rod which
you employ may be the same as we have described
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
in the preceding paragraph. Instead
of agitating the rod in the tube, you may hold
it in a fixed oblique position, and turn the tube
round with the other hand, taking care to
press it continually and regularly against the
rod. See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 6. Very small tubes can
be bordered by approaching their extremities
to a flame not acted upon by the blowpipe;
particularly the flame of a spirit-lamp.</p>

<p>When the edges of a tube are to be rendered
capable of suffering considerable pressure, you
can very considerably augment their strength
by soldering a rib or string of glass all round
the end of the tube&mdash;see <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 12. Holding
the tube in the left hand, and the string of
glass in the right, you expose them both at once
to the flame. When their extremities are sufficiently
softened, you attach the end of the rib
of glass to the tube at a very short distance
from its extremity; you then continue gradually
to turn the tube, so as to cause the rib of glass
to adhere to it, in proportion as it becomes
softened. When the rib has made the entire
circumference of the tube, you separate the
surplus by suddenly darting a strong jet of fire
upon the point where it should be divided;
and you continue to expose the tube to the
flame, always turning it round, until the ring
of glass is fully incorporated with the glass it
was applied to. You then remove the instrument
from the flame, taking care to anneal it in
so doing. During this operation you must
take care to prevent the sinking together of
the sides of the tube, by now and then turning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
the iron rod in its interior. It is a <i>red heat</i>,
or a <i>brownish red heat</i>, that is best adapted to
this operation.</p>

<h3 id="WIDENING">3.&mdash;<small>WIDENING.</small></h3>

<p>When you desire to enlarge the diameter of
the end of a tube, it is necessary, after having
brought it to a soft state, to remove it from the
flame, and to press the sides of the glass outwards
by means of a large rod of iron with a
conical point. The tube must be again heated,
and again pressed with the conical iron rod,
until the proper enlargement is effected. This
operation is much the same as that of bordering
a tube with projecting edges.</p>

<h3 id="DRAWING_OUT">4.&mdash;<small>DRAWING OUT.</small></h3>

<p>You can <i>draw out</i> or <i>contract</i> a tube either
in the middle or at the end. Let us in the
first place consider that a tube is to be drawn
out in the middle. If the tube is long, you
support it with the right hand <i>below</i>, and the
left hand <i>above</i>, by which means you secure
the force that is necessary, as well as the position
which is commodious, for turning it continually
and uniformly in the flame. It must be
kept in the jet till it has acquired a <i>cherry red
heat</i>. You then remove it from the flame, and
always continuing gently to turn it, you gradually
separate the hands from each other, and
draw the tube in a straight line. In this manner
you produce a long thin tube in the centre
of the original tube, which ought to exhibit two
uniform cones where it joins the thin tube, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
to have the points of these cones in the prolongation
of the axis of the tube. See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 3.</p>

<p>To draw out a tube at its extremity, you heat
the extremity till it is in fusion, and then remove
it from the flame; you immediately seize
this extremity with the pliers, and at the same
time separate the two hands. The more rapidly
this operation is performed, the glass being supposed
to be well softened, the more capillary
will the drawn-out point of the tube be rendered.
Instead of pinching the fused end with
the pliers, it is simpler to bring to it the end of
a little auxiliary tube, which should be previously
heated, to fuse the two together, and
then to draw out the end of the original tube
by means of the auxiliary tube&mdash;see <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>,
fig. 4 and 11. In all cases, the smaller the
portion of tube softened, the more abrupt is
the part drawn out.</p>

<p>When you desire to draw out a point from
the side of a tube, you must heat that portion
alone, by holding it fixedly at the extremity of
the jet of flame. When it is sufficiently
softened, solder to it the end of an auxiliary
tube, and then draw it out. <a href="#pl_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 18, exhibits
an example of a tube drawn out laterally.
A <i>red heat</i>, or a <i>cherry red heat</i>, is best adapted
to this operation.</p>

<h3 id="CHOKING">5.&mdash;<small>CHOKING.</small></h3>

<p>We do not mean by <i>choking</i>, the closing or
stopping of the tube, but simply a diminution
of the interior passage, or bore. It is a sort of
contraction. For examples, see <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 15,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
20, 29. You perform the operation by presenting
to the flame a zone of the tube at the
point where the contraction is to be effected.
When the glass is softened, you draw out the
tube, or push it together, according as you
desire to produce a hollow in the surface of
the tube, or to have the surface even, or to
cause a ridge to rise above it. A <i>cherry red
heat</i> is the proper temperature to employ.</p>

<h3 id="SEALING">6.&mdash;<small>SEALING.</small></h3>

<p>If the sides of the tube to be sealed are thin,
and its diameter is small, it is sufficient to expose
the end that you wish to close to the
flame of the lamp. When the glass is softened
it sinks of itself, in consequence of the rotatory
motion given to it, towards the axis of the
tube, and becomes rounded. The application
of no instrument is necessary.</p>

<p>If the tube is of considerable diameter, or
if the sides are thick, you must soften the end,
and then, with a metallic rod or a flat pair of
pliers, mould the sides to a hemisphere, by
bringing the circumference towards the centre,
and continuing to turn the tube in the flame,
until the extremity is well sealed, and perfectly
round. Examples of the figure are to be seen
in <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 3 and 5. Instead of this method,
it is good, when the extremity is sufficiently
softened, to employ an auxiliary tube, with
the help of which you can abruptly draw
out the point of the original tube, which becomes
by that means cut and closed by the
flame. In order that this part may be well
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
rounded, you may, as soon as the tube is sealed,
close the other extremity with a little wax, and
continue to expose the sealed part to the flame,
until it has assumed the form of a <i>drop of tallow</i>.
See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 15. You can also seal in this
fashion, by blowing, with precaution, in the
open end of the tube, while the sealed end is
in a softened state.</p>

<p>If you desire the sealed part to be flat, like
<a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 30, you must press it, while it is
soft, against a flat substance. If you wish it to
be concave, like the bottom of a bottle, or <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>,
fig. 2, you must suck air from the tube with the
mouth; or, instead of that, force the softened
end inwards with a metallic rod. You may
also draw out the end till it be conical, as
<a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 4, or terminate it with a little button,
as <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 6. In some cases the sealed end
is bent laterally; in others it is twirled into a
ring, having previously been drawn out and
stopped in the bore. In short, the form given
to the sealed end of a tube can be modified in
an infinity of ways, according to the object for
which the tube may be destined.</p>

<p>You should take care not to accumulate too
much glass at the place of sealing. If you
allow it to be too thick there, you run the risk
of seeing it crack during the cooling. Some
farther observations on sealing will be found at
the article <i>Water Hammer</i>, in a subsequent
section. The operation of sealing succeeds
best at a <i>cherry-red heat</i>.</p>

<h3 id="BLOWING">7.&mdash;<small>BLOWING.</small></h3>

<p>The construction of a great number of philosophical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
instruments requires that he who would
make them should exercise himself in the art
of blowing <i>bulbs</i> possessing a figure exactly
spherical. This is one of the most difficult
operations.</p>

<p>To blow a bulb at the extremity of a tube,
you commence by sealing it; after which,
you collect at the sealed extremity more or less
glass, according to the size and the solidity
which you desire to give to the bulb. When
the end of the tube is made thick, completely
sealed, and well rounded, you elevate the temperature
to a <i>reddish white</i> heat, taking care
to turn the tube continually and rapidly between
your fingers. When the end is perfectly soft
you remove it from the flame, and, holding the
tube horizontally, you blow quickly with the
mouth into the open end, without discontinuing
for a single moment the movement of rotation.
If the bulb does not by this operation acquire
the necessary size, you soften it again in the
flame, while under the action of which you turn
it very rapidly, lest it should sink together at
the sides, and become deformed. When it is
sufficiently softened you introduce, in the same
manner as before, a fresh quantity of air. It is
of importance to observe that, if the tube be of
a large diameter, it is necessary to contract the
end by which you are to blow, in order that
it may be turned round with facility while in the
mouth.</p>

<p>When the bulb which you desire to make is
to be somewhat large, it is necessary, after
having sealed the tube, to soften it for the space
of about half an inch from its extremity, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
then, with the aid of a flat piece of metal, to
press moderately and repeatedly on the softened
portion, until the sides of the tube which are
thus pressed upon, sink together, and acquire a
certain degree of thickness. During this operation,
however, you must take care to blow,
now and then, into the tube, in order to retain
a hollow space in the midst of the little mass
of glass, and to hinder the bore of the tube from
being closed up. When you have thus, at the
expense of the length of the tube, accumulated
at its extremity a quantity of glass sufficient
to produce a bulb, you have nothing more to
do than to heat the matter till it is raised to a
temperature marked by a <i>reddish-white</i> colour,
and then to expand it by blowing.</p>

<p>Instead of accumulating the glass thus, it is
more expedient to blow on the tube a series of
little bulbs close to one another (see <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 8),
and then, by heating the intervals, and blowing,
to unite these little bulbs into a large one of
convenient dimensions.</p>

<p>We have already observed, and we repeat
here, that it is indispensably necessary to hold
the glass <i>out</i> of the flame during the act of
blowing. This is the only means of maintaining
uniformity of temperature in the whole
softened parts of the tube, without which it is
impossible to produce bulbs with sides of equal
thickness in all their extent.</p>

<p>When you desire to form a bulb at the extremity
of a capillary tube, that is to say, of a
tube which has a bore of very small diameter,
such as the tubes which are commonly employed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
to form thermometers, it would be improper to
blow it with the mouth; were you to do so, the
vapour which would be introduced, having a
great affinity for the glass, would soon obstruct
the little canal, and present to the passage of
the air a resistance, which, with the tubes of
smallest interior diameter, would often be insurmountable.
But, even when the tubes you
employ have not so very small an internal
diameter, you should still take care to avoid
blowing with the mouth; because the introduction
of moisture always injures fine instruments,
and it is impossible to dry the interior of a
capillary tube when once it has become wet.
It is better to make use of a bottle of Indian
rubber, which can be fixed on the open end
of the tube by means of a cork with a hole
bored through it. You press the bottle in the
hand, taking care to hold the tube vertically,
with the hot part <i>upwards</i>; if you were not to
take this precaution, the bulb would be turned
on one side, or would exhibit the form of a
pear, because it is impossible, in this case, to
give to the mass in fusion that rotatory motion
which is necessary, when the tube is held horizontally,
to the production of a globe perfectly
spherical in its form, and with sides of equal
thickness.</p>

<p>Whenever you blow into a tube you should
keep the eye fixed on the dilating bulb, in
order to be able to arrest the passage of air
at the proper moment. If you were not to
attend to this, you would run the risk of giving
to the bulb too great an extension, by which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the sides would be rendered so thin that it
would be liable to be broken by the touch of
the lightest bodies. This is the reason that,
when you desire to obtain a large bulb, it is
necessary to thicken the extremity of the tube,
or to combine many small bulbs in one, that it
may possess more solidity.</p>

<p>In general, when you blow a bulb with the
mouth, it is better to introduce the air a little at
a time, forcing in the small portions very
rapidly one after the other; rather than to attempt
to produce the whole expansion of the
bulb at once: you are then more certain of being
able to arrest the blowing at the proper time.</p>

<p>When you desire to produce a moderate expansion,
either at the extremity or in any other
part of a tube, you are enabled easily to effect
it by the following process, which is founded on
the property possessed by all bodies, and
especially by fluids, of expanding when heated;
a property which characterises air in a
very high degree. After having sealed one end
of the tube and drawn out the other, allow it
to become cold, in order that it may be quite
filled with air; close the end which has been
drawn out, and prevent the air within the tube
from communicating with that at its exterior;
then gradually heat the part which you desire
to have expanded, by turning it gently in the
flame of a lamp. In a short time the softened
matter is acted on by the tension of the air
which is enclosed and heated in the interior of
the tube; the glass expands, and produces a
bulb or swelling more or less extensive, according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
as you expose the glass to a greater or
lesser degree of heat.</p>

<p>To blow a bulb in the middle of a tube, it is
sufficient to seal it at one of its extremities, to
heat the part that you wish to inflate, and,
when it is at a <i>cherry-red</i> heat, to blow in the
tube, which must be held horizontally and
turned with both hands, of which, for the
sake of greater facility, the left may be held
above and the right below.</p>

<p>If the bulb is to be large, the matter must
previously be thickened or accumulated, or,
instead of that, a series of small bulbs first
produced, and these subsequently blown into a
single larger bulb, as we have already mentioned.
See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 8.</p>

<p>For some instruments, the tubes of which
must be capillary, it is necessary to blow the
bulbs separately, and then to solder them to
the requisite adjuncts. The reason of this is,
that it would be too difficult to produce, from
a very fine tube, a bulb of sufficient size and
solidity to answer the intended purpose.</p>

<p>You make choice of a tube which is not
capillary, but of a sufficient diameter, very
cylindrical, with equal sides, and tolerably
substantial: it may generally be from the
twentieth to the twelfth of an inch thick in the
glass. You soften two zones in this tube,
more or less near to each other, according to
the bulk you desire to give to the bulb, and
you draw out the melted part in points. The
talent consists in <i>well-centering</i>&mdash;that is to
say, in drawing out the melted tube in such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
manner that the thin parts or points shall be
situated exactly in the prolongation of the axis
of the little portion of the original tube remaining
between them. This operation is
technically termed drawing <i>a cylinder between
two points</i>. The tube so drawn out is exhibited
by <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 4. You cut these points at
some distance from the central or thick part,
and seal one end; you next completely soften
the little thick tube and expand it into a bulb,
by blowing with the precautions which have
already been described. You must keep the
glass in continual motion, if you desire to be
successful in this experiment. Much rapidity
of movement, and at the same time lightness
of touch, are requisite in the operation here
described. It is termed <i>blowing a bulb between
two points</i>. <a href="#pl_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 10, exhibits a
bulb blown between two points.</p>

<p>To obtain a <i>round</i> bulb, you should hold
the tube horizontally; to obtain a <i>flattened</i>
bulb, you should hold it perpendicularly, with
the fused extremity turned above; to obtain a
<i>pear-shaped</i> bulb, you should hold the fused
extremity downwards.</p>

<p>When you are working upon a bulb between
two points, or in the middle of a tube, you
should hold the tube horizontally, in the ordinary
manner; but you are to push the softened
portion together, or to draw it out, according as
you desire to produce a ridge or a prolongation.</p>

<p>When you are at liberty to choose the point
from which you are to blow, you should prefer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
1st, that where the moisture of the breath can
be the least prejudicial to the instrument which
is to be made; 2dly, that which brings the
part which is to be expanded nearest to your
eye; 3dly, that which presents the fewest difficulties
in the execution. When bulbs are
to be formed in complicated apparatus, it is
good to reflect a little on the best means of
effecting the object. It is easy to understand
that contrivances which may appear very
simple on paper, present difficulties in the
practical execution which often call for considerable
management.</p>

<h3 id="PIERCING">8.&mdash;<small>PIERCING.</small></h3>

<p>You first seal the tube at one extremity, and
then direct the point of the flame on the part
which you desire to pierce. When the tube
has acquired a <i>reddish-white</i> heat, you suddenly
remove it from the flame, and forcibly
blow into it. The softened portion of the tube
gives way before the pressure of the air, and
bursts into a hole. You expose the tube again
to the flame, and border the edges of the hole.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe, that, if
it be a sealed extremity which you desire to
pierce, it is necessary to turn the tube between
the fingers while in the fire; but if, on the contrary,
you desire to pierce a hole in the side of
a tube, you should keep the glass in a fixed
position, and direct the jet upon a single point.</p>

<p>If the side of the tube is thin, you may dispense
with blowing. The tube is sealed and
allowed to cool; then, accurately closing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
open extremity with the finger, or a little wax,
you expose to the jet the part which you desire
to have pierced. When the glass is sufficiently
softened, the air enclosed in the tube being expanded
by the heat, and not finding at the
softened part a sufficient resistance, bursts
through the tube, and thus pierces a hole.</p>

<p>You may generally dispense with the sealing
of the tube, by closing the ends with wax, or
with the fingers.</p>

<p>There is still another method of performing
this operation, which is very expeditious, and
constantly succeeds with objects which have
thin sides. You raise to a <i>reddish white</i> heat
a little cylinder of glass, of the diameter of the
hole that you desire to make, and you instantly
apply it to the tube or globe, to which it will
strongly adhere. You allow the whole to cool,
and then give the auxiliary cylinder a sharp
slight knock; the little cylinder drops off, and
carries with it the portion of the tube to which
it had adhered. On presenting the hole to a
slight degree of heat, you remove the sharpness
of its edges.</p>

<p>When you purpose to pierce a tube laterally,
for the purpose of joining to it another
tube, it is always best to pierce it by blowing
many times, and only a little at a time, and
with that view, to soften the glass but moderately.
By this means the tube preserves
more thickness, and is in a better state to support
the subsequent operation of soldering.</p>

<p>There are circumstances in which you can
pierce tubes by forcibly sucking the air out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of them; and this method sometimes presents
advantages that can be turned to good account.
Finally, the orifices which are produced by
cutting off the lateral point of a tube drawn
out at the side, may also be reckoned as an
operation belonging to this article.</p>

<h3 id="BENDING">9.&mdash;<small>BENDING.</small></h3>

<p>If the tube is narrow, and the sides are
pretty thick, this operation presents no difficulty.
You heat the tube, but not too much, lest it become
deformed; a <i>reddish-brown</i> heat is sufficient,
for at that temperature it gives way to
the slightest effort you make to bend it. You
should, as much as possible, avoid making the
bend too abrupt. For this purpose, you heat
a zone of one or two inches in extent at once,
by moving the tube backwards and forwards in
the flame, and you take care to bend it very
gradually.</p>

<p>But if the tube is large, or its sides are thin,
and you bend it without proper precautions,
the force you employ entirely destroys its cylindrical
form, and the bent part exhibits nothing
but a double flattening,&mdash;a canal, more or less
compressed. To avoid this deformity it is
necessary, first, to seal the tube at one extremity,
and then, while giving it a certain
curvature, to blow cautiously by the other extremity,
which for convenience sake should previously
be drawn out. When tubes have been
deformed by bad bending, as above described,
you may, by following this method, correct the
fault; that is to say, upon sealing one extremity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of the deformed tube, heating the flattened
part, and blowing into the other extremity,
you can with care reproduce the round form.</p>

<p>In general, that a curvature may be well-made,
it is necessary that the side of the tube
which is to form the concave part be sufficiently
softened by heat to sink of itself equally in
every part during the operation, while the other
side be only softened to such a degree as to
enable it to give way under the force applied to
bend it. On this account, after having softened
in a <i>cherry-red heat</i> one side of the tube, you
should turn the other side, which is to form the
exterior of the curvature, towards you, and
then, exposing it to the point of the jet, you
should bend the tube immediately upon its beginning
to sink under the heat.</p>

<p>When you desire to bend the extremity of a
tube into a ring you must employ a metallic
rod, with which, by pressing on the tube, you
separate with a curve, C, (see <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 14) all
the portion A C which is necessary to produce
the desired curl. You then successively soften
all parts of this curve, and gradually twist it in
the direction indicated by the arrow, pressing
the iron rod constantly upon the extremity of
the curve. When the end A comes into contact
with bend C you solder them together
at this point, and thus complete the ring.
<a href="#pl_2">Pl. 2</a>, fig. 27, and <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 27, exhibit examples
of rings formed by this process.</p>

<h3 id="SOLDERING">10.&mdash;<small>SOLDERING.</small></h3>

<p>If the tubes which you propose to solder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
are of a small diameter, pretty equal in size,
and have thick sides, it is sufficient, before
joining them together, to widen them equally at
their extremities, by agitating a metallic rod
within them. (<a href="#pl_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 17.)</p>

<p>But if they have thin sides, or are of a large
diameter, the bringing of their sides into juxta-position
is very difficult, and the method of
soldering just indicated becomes insufficient.
In this case you are obliged to seal, and subsequently
to pierce, the two ends which you
desire to join. The disposition which this operation
gives to their sides very much facilitates
the soldering.</p>

<p>Finally, when the tubes are of a very different
diameter, you must draw out the extremity
of the larger and cut it where the part
drawn out corresponds in diameter to the tube
which it is to be joined to. <a href="#pl_1">Pl. 1</a>, fig. 9 and
15, exhibit examples of this mode of adapting
tubes to one another.</p>

<p>For lateral solderings you must dispose the
tubes in such a manner that the sides of the
orifices which you desire to join together coincide
with each other completely. See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>,
fig. 7.</p>

<p>When the holes are well prepared, you heat
at the same time the two parts that are to be
soldered together, and join them at the moment
when they enter into fusion. You must
push them slightly together, and continue to
heat successively all their points of contact;
whereupon the two tubes soon unite perfectly.
As it is almost always necessary, when you desire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the soldering to be neatly done, or the joint
to be imperceptible, to terminate the operation
by blowing, it is proper to prepare the extreme
ends of the tubes before-hand. That
end of the tube by which you intend to blow
should be carefully drawn out, provided it be
so large as to render drawing out necessary;
and the other end of the tube, if large, should
be closed with wax, as in <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 9, or if
small, should be sealed at the lamp (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>,
fig. 15). When the points of junction are perfectly
softened, and completely incorporated
with each other, you introduce a little air into
the tube, which produces a swelling at the
joint. As soon as this has taken place, you
must gently pull the two ends of the joined
tube in different directions, by which means
the swelled portion at the joint is brought down
to the size of the other parts of the tube, so that
the whole surface becomes continuous. The
soldering is then finished.</p>

<p>To solder a bulb or a cylinder between two
points, to the extremity of a capillary tube, you
cut and seal one of the points at a short distance
from the bulb (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 16), and at the
moment when this extremity is in fusion you
pierce it by blowing strongly at the other extremity.
By this means the opening of the
reservoir is terminated by edges very much
widened, which facilitates considerably its being
brought into juxta-position with the little
tube. In order that the ends of the two tubes
may be well incorporated the one with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
other, you should keep the soldered joint for
some time in the flame, and ought to blow in
the tube, push the ends together and draw them
asunder, until the protuberance is no longer
perceptible.</p>

<p>If, after having joined two tubes, it should
be found that there still exists an opening
too considerable to be closed by simply
pushing the two tubes upon one another, you
can close such an opening by means of a
morsel of glass, applied by presenting the fused
end of an auxiliary tube.</p>

<p>You should avoid soldering together two
different species of glass&mdash;for example, a tube
of ordinary glass with a tube of flint-glass;
because these two species of glass experience
a different degree of contraction upon cooling,
and, if joined together while in a fused state,
are so violently pulled from one another as they
become cool, that the cohesion of the point of
soldering is infallibly overcome, and the tube
breaks. You ought also, for a similar reason,
to take care not to accumulate a greater mass
of glass in one place than in another.</p>

<p>If the first operation has not been sufficient
to complete the soldering, the tube must be
again presented to the flame, and again pushed
together at the joint, or drawn asunder, or blown
into, according as it may appear to be necessary.
In all cases the soldering is not truly
solid, but inasmuch as the two masses of
glass are well incorporated together, and present
a surface continuous in all points.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>The mineralogical flame (<a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 1, A´ B)
is that which is to be employed in preference to
the larger flame, when you desire to effect a
good joining: it is sufficient to proportion the
size of the flame to the object you wish to
execute.

<span id="IV">IV.&mdash;<i>Construction of Chemical and Philosophical
Instruments.</i></span></h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a person is well acquainted with the
fundamental operations which we have just
described, the preparation of the instruments
of which we are about to speak can present
scarcely any difficulty. Indeed, some of them
are so extremely simple, and are so easy of
execution, that it is sufficient to cast a glance
upon the figures which represent them, to seize
at once the method which must be followed in
their construction. Of such instruments we
shall not stop to give a detailed description,
but shall content ourselves with presenting the
design.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is of importance to observe
that a certain number of instruments are
<i>graduated</i> or furnished with pieces, or <i>mountings</i>,
of which it is not the object of our art to
teach the construction, and which demand a
more or less extensive knowledge of the sciences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
We shall treat of these mountings but
summarily, referring the student, for more detailed
instructions, to the works on natural philosophy
and chemistry, in which these instruments
are especially treated of. Our reason
for this is, that we do not wish to abandon the
plan we had adopted of describing simply the
art of glass-blowing. To describe the use and
application of philosophical instruments, or to
explain the principles on which they act, would
be passing quite out of our province.</p>

<p><span id="ADAPTERS" class="smcap">Adapters.</span>&mdash;These are tubes of glass of various
forms, employed in chemistry to connect
together the different pieces constituting an

a receiver during the operation of distillation.
You should take care to border the extremities
of an adapter; or you may widen them into
the form of the mouth of a bottle, when they
are to be closed air-tight by corks. Besides this,
there is nothing particular to be observed in
the preparation of adapters.</p>

should be six or seven feet long, and
about one-third of an inch in diameter. You
commence by making a bend, nearly at a right
angle, about four inches from one of its extremities.

as a handle, and very much facilitates the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
instrument. Divide a barometer tube into
two, three, or four pieces, and reunite the
pieces by intermediate capillary tubes, so as to
form a series of large and small tubes, soldered
alternately the one at the end of the other.
Then communicate to this compound tube the
form exhibited by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 25, and join, at
each superior bend, a little tube, for the convenience
of easily filling the instrument with
mercury: seal these tubes as soon as the mercury
is introduced. The graduation of compound
barometers is made by bringing them
into comparison with a good standard barometer.
After taking two or three fixed points,
it is easy to continue the scale.</p>

<p><span id="GAY_LUSSACS_BAROMETER" class="smcap">Gay Lussac’s Barometer.</span>&mdash;Take a tube
which is very regular in the bore, four-tenths
of an inch in diameter, and thirty-five inches
and a half in length. Seal one of its extremities
and draw out the other; then cut the tube
at about two-thirds of its whole length from the
sealed end, and reunite the two pieces by
means of a capillary tube soldered between
them, the whole being kept in a line. See
<a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 1. Pierce laterally the part of the
tube which is drawn out, at some inches from
the base of the point, and force the margin of
the hole into the interior of the tube, by means
of a conical point of metal, in such a manner as
to form a little sunk funnel, of which the orifice
must be very small. After having introduced
the proper quantity of mercury into the
instrument, boil it, and assist the disengagement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
of the bubbles of air by agitating a fine
iron wire within the tube. Then remove the
part of the tube which was drawn out, by
sealing the end of the wide part. Give to the
whole instrument the curvature indicated by
<a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 3.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="BUNTENS_BAROMETER" class="smcap">Bunten’s Barometer.</span>&mdash;This instrument differs
from the preceding but in one point,
namely, that the capillary tube is formed of
two soldered pieces, of which the one, passing
into the other, is terminated by a capillary
point. This arrangement is exhibited by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>,
fig. 2.</p>

a tube thirty-nine inches
long, with thick sides, and two-tenths of an
inch internal diameter. Seal it at one end,
and choke it at the distance of eight inches
therefrom. Pierce a hole in the tube about
twelve or sixteen inches from the choked part,
and solder to the hole an additional piece,
which can be closed by a cork or covered by
a piece of bladder. The instrument is represented
by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 15.</p>

<p><span id="BELL_GLASSES_FOR_EXPERIMENTS" class="smcap">Bell-Glasses for Experiments.</span>&mdash;These
are pieces of tube sealed at one end, and
widened or bordered at the other. They are
extremely useful, and much employed in chemical
experiments. They also supply the
place of bottles for preserving small quantities
of substances. Sometimes they are required
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
to be straight, as <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 12. Sometimes
they need to be curved, as <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 29. This
is particularly the case when they are to be
employed as retorts, for which purpose the
sealed part should be made thin. <a href="#pl_3">Pl. 3</a>, fig. 6,
exhibits a retort with a tubulure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="BLOWPIPE" class="smcap">Blowpipe.</span>&mdash;We shall give in this article an
account of the various pieces of glass which
form part of the blowpipe described in the
early part of this work. See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 19.</p>

<p>The beak C, which is employed with the
candlestick, is merely a bent tube, at the extremity
of which a bulb is blown. The bulb is
terminated by a point, the thickness of the
sides of which is augmented by turning it for a
long time in the flame.</p>

<p>As for the beak used with the lamp, it is
simply a bent tube C´, of which the orifice has
been diminished by turning it round in the flame.
The point of this beak is not drawn out like
that of the beak described in the preceding paragraph,
but is allowed to be thick, that it may
not melt in the flame of the lamp.</p>

<p>The tube D F has four-tenths of an inch internal
diameter, and is pretty thick in the sides.
You must commence by bordering and slightly
widening one of its extremities, and then proceed
to choke it at about two inches from its
other extremity, taking care to give to the
choked part a figure as perfectly conical as
possible, in order that the valve may act well.
We have described the valve at length at p. 6.</p>

<p>The tube <i>d</i> is as much narrower than the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
tube D F as is necessary to permit it to pass up
and down within the latter. Its use is to
lengthen or shorten the tube for the convenience
of the blower. The lower end is wound
round with waxed thread, to make it fit air-tight.
The mouth-piece is executed by widening
the end of the tube, and then, while the
widened part is still soft, by pressing the two
sides obliquely, one against the other. By this
means you give to the mouth-piece a flattened
form, which adapts it better to the lips. The
tube is finished by slightly bending this extremity.</p>

<p>In order that the bladder, or air reservoir,
may be conveniently and securely attached to
the tube E, you must take care to widen the
end of this tube, and to turn up the edges
strongly, by pressing the soft end against a
flat metallic surface.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="CAPSULES" class="smcap">Capsules.</span>&mdash;These are very small mercury
funnels, of which the opening or neck has been
closed. To transform these funnels into capsules,
you must cut the neck as close as possible,
and then soften, close, and flatten the
opening. In performing this operation, hold
the capsule by the edge with your pincers, and
employ a piece of metal to press the glass together
and make it close the hole and form
the flat bottom of the capsule. See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>,
fig. 23.</p>

<p><i>Another Method.</i>&mdash;After having blown a
bulb at the end of a point, soften a narrow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
zone of the bulb, and then blow suddenly and
strongly into it; by which means you separate
the bulb into two capsules, which only need to
be bordered. If you find any difficulty in presenting
to the flame the capsule which forms
the part of the bulb opposed to the point, you
can attach to it a little rod of glass, which you
can afterwards easily separate by a slight
smart blow.</p>

<p>Occasionally you will have to make <i>capsules
with double sides</i>, which will be described at
the article <i>Nicholson’s Hydrometer</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="CARTESIAN_DEVILS" class="smcap">Cartesian Devils.</span>&mdash;Blow a bulb at the
extremity of a very small tube, and heat a portion
of the bulb, for the purpose of prolonging
it into a beak. This can be effected with the
aid of an auxiliary tube, which, on being joined
to the heated part of the bulb, carries away
with it the portion of glass which adheres.
This portion of the bulb becomes thus prolonged
into a little point, which must be cut at
its extremity, so as to leave a small opening.
The principal tube must be cut at the distance
of half an inch from the bulb, and the ends of
it must be drawn out and twisted into a ring.
Instead of forming laterally a little beak to the
bulb, you may pierce the tail, after twisting it
into the form of a ring, or you may manage in
such a manner as not to obliterate the canal of
the twisted part. In general, little enamel
figures are suspended to the ring of these
globes, as is represented by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 22. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
simple bulb, blown at the extremity of a small
portion of tube, can supply the place of the
Ludion or Cartesian devil. See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 8.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="COMMUNICATING_VASES" class="smcap">Communicating Vases.</span>&mdash;Employ a tube of
a large diameter; terminate one of its extremities
with a funnel, fashion the other like
the neck of a bottle; and bend the tube into
the shape shewn by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 11. Then twist
some other tubes into various forms, according
to the end you propose to attain, and adjust
these tubes to the neck of the large tube by
means of corks, which have holes bored
through them. In this manner an exchange of
tubes is provided for various experiments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="DROPPING_TUBES" class="smcap">Dropping Tubes.</span>&mdash;The name <i>dropping tube</i>
is given to an instrument of glass which is very
much employed in chemistry, for the purpose
of transferring small quantities of liquor from
one vessel into another, without disturbing either
of the vessels. Dropping tubes are made of
a great variety of forms and sizes, according to
the purposes to which they are intended to
be applied.</p>

<p>Blow a bulb between two points, and then,
before the glass has regained its consistence,
lengthen the bulb into an oval form. Cut and
border the two points.</p>

<p>If the bulb, or reservoir, is to be so large
that it cannot be formed at the expense of the
thickness of the tube, and yet be sufficiently
strong, it must be blown separately from a
larger tube, and then soldered to two smaller
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
tubes, one of which should have a certain curvature
given to it. See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 20.</p>

<p>Sometimes a dropping tube is employed to
measure small quantities of liquid. In this
case the point should be drawn off abruptly,
and the scale should be marked on the shank
or tube with spots of black enamel.</p>

<p><a href="#pl_2">Pl. 2</a>, fig. 21, represents a peculiar variety
of dropping tube employed in some experiments.
It is made in the same manner as the
common dropping tubes, excepting that, when
the tail is formed, it is sealed at the extremity,
bent there into a ring, and then pierced at A.</p>

<p><a href="#pl_3">Pl. 3</a>, fig. 26, represents another variety of
dropping tube, a description of which is unnecessary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="FOUNTAINS" class="smcap">Fountains.</span>&mdash;It will readily be understood
by those acquainted with the construction of
hydraulic apparatus, that, by means of a judicious
arrangement of glass tubes, a great variety
of fountains may be produced. The following
are given as examples.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="FOUNTAIN_OF_CIRCULATION" class="smcap">Fountain of Circulation.</span>&mdash;Take a tube,
twenty-four or thirty inches long, nearly half an
inch in diameter, and with pretty thick sides;
blow a bulb at one of its extremities, and bend
the other into a U, after having drawn it out as
indicated by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 4. Pierce the tube at
B, and join there a short piece adapted to receive
a cork. Then prepare a bulb of the
same size as the first bulb, and solder it to the
extremity of a very long and almost capillary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
tube, which you must bend in zig-zag, in such
a manner as to make it represent a Maltese
cross, a star, a rose, or any other figure that
may be suggested. The side of the bulb opposite
to that which is attached to this twisted
tube, ought to be formed like the neck of a
bottle, in order that it may receive the drawn-out
part of the larger tube, which should enter
the bulb until the point of the large tube nearly
touches the neck of the little tube at its junction
with the bulb. This disposition is shewn
in the figure. Seal now the other end of the
little tube to the bulb of the large tube; then,
with a little cement or sealing-wax, close the
space between the bulb of the little tube and
the point of the large tube. The instrument
being thus prepared, as much alcohol, previously
coloured red, must be inserted by the
neck <i>b</i> as is sufficient to fill one of the bulbs.
The neck is then closed with a cork, and a little
cement or sealing-wax. Or, instead of forming
this neck to the instrument, the additional
piece may be drawn out to a point, which permits
it to be sealed hermetically.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="FOUNTAIN_OF_COMPRESSION" class="smcap">Fountain of Compression.</span>&mdash;Introduce into
a tube of large diameter a piece of capillary
tube with thick sides. This must pass a little
beyond the extremity of the large tube, which
is to be softened and soldered to the other, so
that it shall be fixed concentrically. The common
point is then to be drawn out. When the
tube is quite cold, and the small tube properly
fixed in the centre of the large one, cut the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
latter at a proper distance, border it, and choke
it near the end, which must be fashioned in
such a manner as to be capable of being completely
closed by a cork. See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 29.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="INTERMITTING_FOUNTAIN" class="smcap">Intermitting Fountain.</span>&mdash;This apparatus is
represented by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 16. Solder a cylindrical
reservoir to the extremity of a capillary
tube, pierced at <i>a</i>, and sealed at its extremity.
Draw out abruptly the point of the reservoir,
and give it a very small orifice; then give to
the capillary tube the form indicated by the
figure. Prepare next a funnel resembling a
mercury-funnel, but much larger; choke the
neck of this funnel, and bend the tube into the
form of a syphon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="HEROS_FOUNTAIN" class="smcap">Hero’s Fountain.</span>&mdash;Solder a bulb to the extremity
of a tube, and transform the bulb into
a funnel. Close the funnel with a cork, and
solder to the other end of the tube a bulb similar
to the first. Next, solder a third bulb between
two tubes, of which one must be twice
as long the other; solder the longer of these
tubes to the bulb of the first tube, and draw
out the point of the shorter tube. You have
now a long tube, with a funnel at one end, a
contracted point at the other, and two bulbs in
its length. Give to the whole apparatus the
form indicated by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 21.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="FUNNELS" class="smcap">Funnels.</span>&mdash;It will be seen, upon looking
over the engravings, that funnels require to be
made for a great variety of instruments; you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
ought therefore to acquire as soon as possible
the art of making them well. The following
are those most frequently required.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="RETORT_FUNNEL" class="smcap">Retort Funnel.</span>&mdash;Blow a bulb at the extremity
of a tube; present the superior hemisphere
of the bulb to the flame, and when it is
sufficiently softened, blow strongly into the
other end of the tube. The air will force its
way through the bulb, making a hole which
will be larger or smaller according to the extent
of surface which may have been softened.
The opening of the funnel being made thus,
there is nothing more to do than to adjust the
edges, which, in the present state, are both
fragile and irregular. This it is very easy to
do. The edges are softened, the most prominent
parts are cut off with the scissars, and the
parts which are thin are bent back on themselves,
that they may become thicker. Upon
turning the funnel round in the flame, the
smaller irregularities give way, and the edges
become rounded. See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 24.</p>

<p>When the funnel is desired to be very large
in proportion to the size of the tube, a bulb is
made from a larger tube, and afterwards soldered
to the small tube, and transformed into a
funnel in the manner above described.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="FUNNEL_FOR_INTRODUCING_MERCURY_INTO_NARROW_TUBES" class="smcap">Funnel for introducing Mercury into
narrow tubes.</span>&mdash;The mercury-funnel is represented
by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 25. Blow a bulb between
two points; cut off one of the points, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
open the bulb at that place, in the manner described
in the preceding article.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="HYDROSTATIC_FUNNEL" class="smcap">Hydrostatic Funnel.</span>&mdash;This is represented
by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 31. It is an instrument of constant
use in chemical experiments. Form a
funnel at the extremity of a tube in the manner
described above, having previously blown a
bulb near the middle of the tube. When this
has been done, bend the tube into the form
shown by the figure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="HOUR_GLASSES" class="smcap">Hour-Glasses.</span>&mdash;Blow four bulbs on a tube
close to each other; open the two end bulbs
like funnels, and then form them into flat supports
or pedestals, according to the method
described at the article <i>Test-glass with a foot</i>.
Obstruct entirely the canal which separates
one of these feet; choke to a certain extent the
passage between the two remaining bulbs;
and close the canal between the other foot and
the bulbs, after introducing the quantity of sand
which you have found to be necessary. See
<a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 13.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="HYDRAULIC_RAM" class="smcap">Hydraulic Ram.</span>&mdash;This instrument is represented
by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 15. Employ a tube about
six feet long, with thick sides and of large
diameter. Seal it at one extremity, <i>k</i>, and
border it at the other; solder at <i>p</i> an additional
piece, choked so as to receive a valve.
Pierce the tube at <i>l</i>; draw it out, and fix a
funnel there; then twist the tube into a spiral.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Form, on the other hand, a fountain of compression,
<i>o</i>, and a funnel, <i>m</i>; and fix both of
these pieces by means of sealing-wax, as soon
as the two valves <i>p</i> and <i>l</i> have been put into
their places.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="HYDROMETERS" class="smcap">Hydrometers.</span>&mdash;<i>Hydrometers</i> are instruments
which, on being plunged into liquids,
indicate immediately their density or specific
gravity. <span id="AREOMETERS"><i>Areometers</i></span> differ from hydrometers
sometimes in graduation, sometimes merely in
name. The following are examples of hydrometers,
of which a great many varieties are in use.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="BAUMÉS_HYDROMETER" class="smcap">Baumé’s Hydrometer.</span>&mdash;Make a cylinder
between two points, and solder it to the extremity
of a tube with thin sides, and which must
be very regular on the outside. Close the
open part which is to form the stalk of the
hydrometer with a little wax. See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig.
9 and 15. When the soldering, which must
be well done, is complete, and the stalk well
centered, choke the reservoir at a little distance
from the base of the point, by drawing it out
in such a manner as considerably to diminish
the canal in this part. Remove then the ball
of wax which closed the tube, draw off the
point of the cylinder, and make the part which
was pulled away from the cylinder by the
choking, into a bulb, by blowing with precaution
into the tube. If the reservoir is required
to be spherical instead of cylindrical, it must
be softened and expanded by blowing. When
it is intended to ballast the instrument with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
mercury, the canal must be completely stopped
at the point where it is choked. In this case,
the part drawn away from the cylinder is expanded
into a bulb by blowing through the
extreme point, which is to be cut off after the
instrument is completed.</p>

<p>In the first case, you ballast the instrument
with lead shot, which you fix in the lower bulb
by means of a little wax, which closes the
canal at the choked part. In the second case,
after having proved the ballast by putting it
first into the large reservoir, it is removed into
the little bulb, and the latter is immediately
sealed.</p>

<p>One of the essential conditions of a good
hydrometer is that the stalk should keep a perfectly
vertical position when the instrument is
plunged in water. If, therefore, on proving
the ballast, you perceive the stalk to rest obliquely,
you must take care, on retiring it from
the water, to wipe it dry, and to present the
choked part between the cylinder and the little
bulb to the flame; when it is softened, it is
easy, by giving it a slight bend in the direction
where the stalk of the hydrometer passes from
the vertical, to rectify the defect.</p>

<p>Finally, when the instrument is ballasted,
you must seal the stalk, after having fixed in its
interior the strip of paper which bears the graduated
division.</p>

<p>This method of operation serves equally for
all the areometers known under the names of
<i>areometer of Baumé</i>, <i>pèse-sels</i>, <i>pèse-liqueurs</i>,
<i>pèse-acides</i>, and <i>hydrometers</i>, which differ only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in the scheme of their graduation. As to the
<i>size</i> and the <i>length</i> of the stalks, they depend
upon the <i>dimensions</i> you desire to give to the
degrees of the scale, and upon the <i>use</i> to which
the instruments are destined. For the areometer
of Baumé, and for the <i>pèse-sels</i>, the stalks
are generally thicker and shorter than for hydrometers.
<a href="#pl_4">Pl. 4</a>, fig. 19, 20, and 21, represent
different hydrometers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="NICHOLSONS_HYDROMETER" class="smcap">Nicholson’s Hydrometer.</span>&mdash;Solder a bulb
to the extremity of a capillary tube; open it so
as to form a very wide funnel, or rather capsule;
border the edges, and melt the point of junction
with the tube so as to close the opening of
the latter. Solder the other extremity of the
tube to a cylindrical reservoir. Soften the
point at the lower extremity of the cylinder,
and obstruct the canal so as to convert the point
into a glass rod; bend this rod into a hook.
Now blow a bulb at the end of a point, as if
to make a mercury funnel; but, after having
softened the hemisphere of the bulb opposite to
the point, and placed the latter in the mouth,
instead of blowing into the bulb so as to make
a funnel, strongly suck air from the bulb: by
this means the softened part of the glass is
drawn inwards, and you obtain a capsule with
double sides, as exhibited by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 17.
This capsule must have a small handle fastened
across it, by which it may be hung to the
hook formed at the bottom of the cylinder described
above.</p>

<p>This hydrometer being always brought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the same level, the point to which it must be
sunk in the liquid experimented with, is marked
on the stalk by applying a little spot of black
enamel. The instrument is represented by
<a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 23. A variation in form is shewn
by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 22.</p>

<p><span id="HYDROMETER_WITH_TWO_BRANCHES" class="smcap">Hydrometer with two Branches.</span>&mdash;To
measure the relative density of two liquids
which have no action on each other, you employ
a simple tube, bent in the middle and widened
at its two extremities. See <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 11.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="HYDROMETER_WITH_THREE_BRANCHES" class="smcap">Hydrometer with three Branches.</span>&mdash;This

the two branches become parallel. To this tube
another is soldered at the point of curvature,
and is bent in the direction exhibited by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>,
fig. 12. When the two branches are put into
different liquids, and the operator sucks air
from the third branch, the two liquids rise in
their respective tubes to heights which are
in the inverse ratio of their specific gravities.</p>

tube at one end, blow a bulb with thick sides
near the middle, and curl it in S, just as is represented
by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 9. For manometers
which serve to measure the elasticity of the
air under the receiver of the air-pump, what
is generally employed is a tube closed at one
end and bent into a U. <a href="#pl_2">Pl. 2</a>, fig. 10. You
should take care to contract these at some distance
from the sealed part, in order to avoid
the breaking of the instrument on the sudden
admission of air. Manometers are graduated,
as will be explained in the sequel.</p>

will adapt a valve. Pierce the wide tube or
body of the pump at D, and solder there a
piece of tube bent into an elbow and widened
at the other end into a funnel, which is to be
furnished with a second valve, as is represented
in the figure. Prepare then the fountain of

prepare the piston, A, blow a bulb at the end of
a tube, flatten the end of the bulb, and choke it
across the middle, in order to form a place
round which tow can be twisted, to make it fit
the tube air-tight. Finish the piston by twisting
the other end of the tube into a ring, as at

<p><span id="RUMFORDS_THERMOSCOPE" class="smcap">Rumford’s Thermoscope.</span>&mdash;This instrument
is represented by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 35. It is necessary
to take a tube almost capillary, to solder a bulb
at each extremity, to pierce it laterally at <i>b</i>, and
to solder there a piece of tube previously drawn
out, but of which you open the point for the
purpose of finishing the sealing of the bulb A.
After doing this, you bend the two branches,
as shewn in the figure. When the liquid has
been introduced into the instrument, you must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
seal the little piece of tube which serves as a
reservoir.</p>

<p>This instrument can be made in another manner.
Take two pieces of tube, one of them
twice as long as the other; solder a bulb at one
end of each of these tubes, and at about the
third part of the length of the long tube, parting
from the bulb, bend it at a right angle; pierce
the little tube at a corresponding distance, and
solder to the hole the end of the long tube. The
soldering being finished, and the whole system
having the form indicated by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 35, introduce,
by the open end of the short tube, a
small quantity of coloured acid, and then seal
the end of the short tube, which serves as a
reservoir.</p>

<p>The interior diameter of the tubes which are
generally employed as thermoscopes, is one-eighth

<p><span id="SYPHONS" class="smcap">Syphons.</span>&mdash;The <i>simple syphon</i> is a glass tube
bent, at a little distance from the middle, into a
form which is intermediate between those of
⋂ and ⋀, the legs being stretched apart like
those of the latter, but the bend being rounded
like that of the former. The tube is bent <i>near</i>
the middle, and <i>not exactly at</i> the middle, in
order that the legs may be of unequal lengths;
an arrangement which is indispensable. Syphons
are made of different lengths and diameters,
for various purposes. They can be made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
of tubes so capillary that it is sufficient to put
them into water to make them act: the liquid
rises in them by capillary attraction, and does
not require to be sucked through the tube, as
it does when large syphons are employed.</p>

pierce it at some inches from the contracted extremity,
and solder to the hole a little tube of
which the other end has been closed with wax.
Give the tube the bend necessary to constitute a
syphon, and open the two branches. The soldering
of the two tubes is facilitated by giving
to the extremity of the little tube a bend which
adapts it to be applied parallel to the large tube.
When the syphon is desired to be well finished,
the mouth-piece of the little tube must be bordered
and widened, and a bulb must be blown
near the mouth-piece.</p>

part in such a manner as to be able to introduce,
through the orifice, the extremity, also
drawn out, of another tube, which should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
almost capillary. Solder these together in such
a manner that the point of the small tube shall
remain fixed about an inch within the interior of
the reservoir. Pierce again the latter, at B,
and solder there another branch of the same
diameter as the former; but fix it in such a
manner that its side shall be contiguous to the
side of the reservoir. Finally, give to the
branches the bend represented by the figure.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the contracted part to the fire, so as totally to
close the passage. Border and soften the funnel,
and by pressing it against a flat plate of
metal give it the form of a foot, or pedestal.
Cut the tube at the length which you desire the
test-glass to have, and border the edges of the
opening. This is a very useful little chemical
instrument. It is represented by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 10.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="THERMOMETERS" class="smcap">Thermometers.</span>&mdash;Thermometers are instruments
employed for appreciating changes of
temperature, either in the atmosphere or in substances
which we have occasion to examine.
The following are the principal varieties now
employed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="ORDINARY_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Ordinary Thermometer.</span>&mdash;If you desire to
make standard thermometers, you must have
capillary tubes of perfect accuracy in the bore.
You are assured of regularity in the diameter
of a tube when a drop of mercury, made to
pass along the canal by means of a gentle inclination,
or by air blown from an Indian-rubber
bottle, gives everywhere a metallic column
of the same length.</p>

<p>For ordinary thermometers this precaution is
superfluous. In all cases you employ a tube
more or less capillary, at one of the extremities
of which you blow or solder a spherical or cylindrical
reservoir. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 1 and 2.
You fill the instrument with well-purified mercury,
or alcohol, which you boil in the tube, in
order to chase the air from it. As it is necessary
to heat the instrument throughout its
whole length, you must place it on a railing of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
iron wire, inclined in the manner represented by
<a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 14, and covered with burning charcoal,
or red-hot wood ashes. It is better, however,
to employ a kind of muff, formed of two
concentric wire grates, between which you put
burning charcoal, and reserve the centre for the
instrument. The tube is thus kept in a vertical
position, which allows the bubbles of air to
escape with more facility. An iron wire is
made use of to fasten the tube precisely in the
centre of the column of fire. The operation is
considerably promoted by soldering a little
funnel to the upper extremity of the thermometer
tube; and, in order to avoid the interruption
of the column of liquid by bubbles of air,
it is better to give to the superior part of the
reservoir the form of a cone (<a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 3), rather
than to preserve the completely spherical
form indicated by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 2.</p>

<p>When the ebullition has expelled all the air
which was contained in the mercury, or alcohol,
you immediately plunge the open extremity of
the instrument into a vessel filled with one or the
other of these liquids; or, instead of this, you
pour the liquid into the funnel, in order that the
instrument may be quite filled at the common
temperature. You then cut off the funnel, if
one has been used, and, by properly elevating
the temperature of the reservoir, you expel so
much of the liquid that the summit of the column
rests at the point which you desire to
make choice of for the mean temperature: this
operation is termed <i>regulating the course of
the thermometer</i>.</p>

<p>There are two methods of closing thermometers:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
you may either produce a vacuum above
the column of mercury, or you may allow air
to remain there. In the first case, after having
drawn out the end of the tube, you heat the
liquid until a single drop passes out of the
opening; you then instantly bring the point
into the jet, and seal it.</p>

<p>In the second case, you seal the instrument
at the ordinary temperature, and having previously
raised to a reddish-white heat the
button of glass which is formed by the sealing,
you suddenly elevate the temperature of the
mercury. The liquid, on rising, compresses
the enclosed air, which dilates the red-hot
button at the summit of the tube, and produces
a species of reservoir. This reservoir is indispensably
necessary when you leave air above
the column of liquid, in order to provide
against the bursting of the instrument on those
occasions when the temperature of the mercury
comes to be considerably elevated. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>,
fig. 13.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="DIAL_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Dial Thermometer.</span>&mdash;Terminate a piece of
tube, of six-tenths of an inch in diameter, with
two points, and solder to one of these points a
tube one-eighth of an inch in diameter and six
inches long; close the end of this small tube,
and, heating a zone of the reservoir, near the
base of the other point, blow a bulb there.
Cut off the point by which you have blown, at
a little distance from the bulb; open and border
the end of the narrow tube, and bend it
into a U. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 16.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>Fill the bulb and the reservoir with alcohol,
and add a drop of mercury which fills a certain
space in the narrow tube. This mercury
bears on its surface a little iron weight, to
which a thread is fastened; the other end of
this thread passes over a pulley, whose axis
turns a needle. The expansion or contraction
of the alcohol causes the mercury to rise and
fall, and consequently produces a movement of
the needle or index of the dial. This thermometer
is graduated like the others, by being
brought into comparison with a standard thermometer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="CHEMICAL_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Chemical Thermometer.</span>&mdash;This instrument
is merely a common thermometer, the divisions
of which, graduated on paper, are enclosed in
a very thin glass tube, to hinder them from
being altered or destroyed when the instrument
is plunged into liquids. <a href="#pl_4">Pl. 4</a>, fig. 4, 5, 6, and
7, represent chemical thermometers of various
kinds.</p>

<p>The case of the thermometer can be made
in two different ways. According to the first,
you take a tube of a pretty large diameter, and
with very thin sides; you draw out one end and
obliterate the point, which you bend into a
ring, in a direction perpendicular to that of the
case; you pass through this ring the stalk of
the thermometer, which is thus placed parallel
to the large tube. After having fixed the graduated
scale in the interior of the case, by
means of a small drop of sealing-wax, which
has been dropped on the slip of paper, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
which, being supported against the side of the
case, needs only to be warmed to adhere there
and fix the scale securely to its envelope, you
close the upper extremity of the case by drawing
it out, obliterating the canal and soldering
it to the thermometer tube which has been introduced
into the ring at the lower end of the
case. You heat the connecting piece till it is
soft, and then push the thermometer up and
down until the zero marked on its tube corresponds
with the zero marked on the scale
within the case. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The second method of making the case is as
follows:&mdash;You take a tube with thin sides, and
sufficiently large to contain the entire thermometer;
you draw out the tube at one end, and
choke it at some distance from the point of the
contracted part. This you must do in such a
manner as to form a little bulb, which is to be
ballasted in the manner described at the article
<i>Hydrometers</i>. After having introduced into
the case a little ball of cotton, you place therein
the thermometer, furnished with its scale,
and in such a manner that the reservoir rests on
the cotton. You terminate the upper end of
the case either with a ring or by a contraction
which permits the instrument to be suspended
by a cord. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 4 and 5.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="SPIRAL_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Spiral Thermometer.</span>&mdash;Take a tube which
is not capillary, but which has thin sides; close
one of its ends, and bend it round by pressing
it with a metallic rod; continue to bend it
round till it has made several turns, all in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
same plane. See <a href="#pl_1">pl. 1</a>, fig. 13. The latter
turns may be managed with the fingers instead
of the metallic rod. When the reservoir so
formed is sufficiently large, solder to the end of
it a capillary tube, which you point in a direction
perpendicular to that of the axis of the
spiral. The instrument is represented by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>,
fig. 8.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="POCKET_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Pocket Thermometer.</span>&mdash;The pocket thermometer
differs in nothing from the thermometer
just described, except that the capillary tube,
instead of passing away from the spiral in a
straight line, is turned round, so as to form a
continuation of the spiral. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 17.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="MAXIMUM_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Maximum Thermometer.</span>&mdash;This instrument
consists of an ordinary mercurial thermometer,
bent at a right angle near the origin of the reservoir,
and in the horizontal column of which
a little steel or iron rod has been introduced:
this rod, by gliding in the tube, where it experiences
very little friction, serves as an index.
Since this index does not permit the instrument
to be sealed with the vacuum above the mercury,
you must terminate the sealing by a little
reservoir, as we have described at the article on
the second method of closing thermometers.
The instrument is represented by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 24.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="MINIMUM_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Minimum Thermometer.</span>&mdash;This instrument
is constructed pretty nearly in the same manner
as the preceding. The liquid, however,
must be alcohol, and the index a little rod of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
enamel, which ought not to be quite so large as
the bore of the thermometer tube. You seal
the tube by making a vacuum above the column.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="BELLANIS_MAXIMUM_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Bellani’s Maximum Thermometer.</span>&mdash;This
thermometer is represented by <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 9.
Take a tube which is very regular, and about
one-eighth or one-twelfth of an inch diameter in
the bore; solder a reservoir at each end, one
of them much larger than the other; make a
bend near the large reservoir, and then fill the
instrument with alcohol to A. Above that,
place the first index, which consists of a very
small piece of tube closed at one end and cut
off square at the other. In the interior of this
tube the two ends of a hair are fixed, by means
of a little rod of iron, which is pushed into the
tube. Introduce a quantity of mercury above
this index, make the bend B, add again mercury
as far as C, then another index similar to
the first. Finally, fill the rest of the tube and
the half the little reservoir with alcohol, and
seal the point.</p>

<p><span id="DIFFERENTIAL_THERMOMETER" class="smcap">Differential Thermometer.</span>&mdash;This instrument
is represented by <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 14. Take a
tube ten or twelve inches long, and one-eighth
or one-twelfth of an inch internal diameter;
blow a bulb at one end, and bend the tube at a
right angle towards the fourth part of its length.
Prepare a second tube in the same manner, and
solder the bent ends together, so as to form a
single tube with a bulb at each end, having previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
poured into one of the bulbs a small
quantity of sulphuric acid tinged red.</p>

<p>Instead of following the above method, you
may take a single tube of twenty or twenty-four
inches in length, and of the above-mentioned
diameter; you solder a bulb at each end,
bend the tube twice till it represents the figure,
pour in the acid, and then seal the open points.
The graduation of the differential thermometer,
as well as of all the other thermometers, is described
in a subsequent section.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="TUBE_FOR_CRYSTALLIZING_SPERMACETI" class="smcap">Tube for Crystallizing Spermaceti.</span>&mdash;Take
a little capillary tube; curl one of its ends
into a ring, and solder the other to a cylindrical
reservoir, two-thirds of the capacity of
which you fill with very pure spermaceti dissolved
in sulphuric ether; you then seal the
point of the reservoir. See <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 27.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tubes for exposing Substances to Heat
and Gases.</span>&mdash;This instrument consists of a
tube bent in the middle into a U. <a href="#pl_3">Pl. 3</a>, fig. 3.
It is much employed in chemistry, for containing
substances which we wish at the same
time to expose to an elevated temperature and
to the action of certain gases. This tube can
also be employed for cooling gases, or liquids,
in distillation; the bent part being, in this case,
dipped into water or a freezing mixture, or enveloped
in wet paper or cloth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Tubes for the Preservation of Objects
of Natural History, or of Chemical Preparations.</span>&mdash;Take
a tube of which the width
and length corresponds with the object which is
to be enclosed; draw it out at one end, and,
after having obstructed the point, twist it into a
ring. Introduce the object by the open extremity,
which you must afterwards draw out;
fill the tube with the liquid necessary to preserve
the object, and then seal the point. See
<a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 27.</p>

<p>If you desire to have the power of taking out
the object at will&mdash;as, for example, when grain
is preserved, or when, in chemistry, the tube is
employed to contain salts and other compounds,
of which small quantities are now and then required
for use&mdash;you do not seal the end of the
receiver, but border it in such a manner that it
can be closed by a cork.</p>

<p>In some cases a cork is not sufficient to secure
the substance from the action of air: it
must then be assisted with a little cement. By
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
melting together two parts of yellow wax, one
part of turpentine, and a small quantity of
Venetian red, a very useful cement for such
purposes is obtained.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to <i>suspend</i> the objects
enclosed within the tube: you then introduce
a little glass hook, the tail of which you
solder to the upper extremity of the tube;
managing this operation at the same time that
you make the external ring for the support of
the instrument. By turning the hook round
cautiously, which is done when the end of the
tube is in a soft state, and by cooling the whole
with care, you may succeed in fixing the hook
in the centre of the tube. See <a href="#pl_3">pl. 3</a>, fig. 20.</p>

<p><span id="VIAL_OF_THE_FOUR_ELEMENTS" class="smcap">Vial of the Four Elements.</span>&mdash;This instrument
is represented by <a href="#pl_2">pl. 2</a>, fig. 27. Take a
tube drawn out at one end, obstruct the canal
two inches from the extremity, and twist the
contracted part into a ring. Draw out the
other end of the tube, introduce the proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
liquids, remove the point of the tube, and seal
it. The liquids generally employed for filling
the vial of the four elements are, 1. Mercury;
2. A very concentrated solution of carbonate of
potash; 3. Oil of turpentine; 4. Alcohol. A
portion of air is also allowed to remain in the
tube.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="WATER_HAMMER" class="smcap">Water Hammer.</span>&mdash;<a href="#pl_2">Pl. 2</a>, fig. 18, is a representation
of this instrument. Choose a tube
of a good diameter, and with thick sides; seal
it at one end and draw it out at the other.
Blow a bulb at the base of the contracted part;
then, having put a quantity of water in the
tube, let it boil therein, to expel the atmospherical
air. When you imagine that all the air
has been expelled, and that nothing remains in
the tube but steam and water, seal the open
point.</p>

<p>When you have to seal a tube in this manner,
you should be careful to draw out the extremity
of the tube somewhat abruptly, and
leave a very small opening, so that it shall be
sufficient to expose the point to the jet of a
candle blown by a mouth blowpipe, to have the
sealing completely and suddenly effected. You
can afterwards round this sealed part by turning
it in the flame of the lamp, provided, however,
that you have preserved a sufficient thickness
of glass at the sides of the point. If you
omit to take this precaution, the pressure of the
atmosphere, acting with great force on the
softened glass when it is unsupported by the
partial vacuum within the tube, is capable of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
producing such a flattening, or even sinking in
of the matter, as could not subsequently be rectified;
except, indeed, by heating simultaneously
the liquid contained in the tube and the
glass to be mended, which is an operation of a
very delicate description.</p>

<p><span id="WELTERS_SAFETY_TUBES" class="smcap">Welter’s Safety Tubes.</span>&mdash;After having
closed a tube at one end and drawn it out at

plate 3, fig. 18. Pierce it then laterally, in the
middle of the part <i>a b</i>, and solder there the extremity
of a tube, to the other end of which a
funnel has been soldered: it is necessary that
the funnel be closed by a cork. The soldering
being terminated, a bulb must be blown and
the tube bent in S, in the manner shewn by the

<h3 id="OF_THE_SUBSTANCES_EMPLOYED_IN_THE_PREPARATION_OF_THESE_INSTRUMENTS">OF THE SUBSTANCES EMPLOYED IN THE PREPARATION
OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.</h3>

<p>Before proceeding to the subject of <i>graduation</i>,
it is necessary to say a few words respecting
the substances which are generally employed
to fill a variety of instruments, particularly
barometers and thermometers.</p>

<p><i>Mercury.</i>&mdash;It ought to be completely purified
from all foreign substances. You can
separate it from the dust it may contain by
passing it through a piece of chamois leather;
you tie a very hard knot, and by pressure oblige
the mercury to pass out in a fine rain. This
process is sufficient for the purification of mercury
which merely contains extraneous bodies
in suspension; but it is not sufficient when the
mercury to be purified contains tin, lead, or
other metals, in solution. It is then necessary
to distil the mercury; upon which the fixed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
metals remain behind. The oxide of mercury
produced by the distillation is removed by agitating
the distilled metal with sulphuric acid,
and subsequently washing it with a large quantity
of water, till all the acid is removed; it is
then dried as completely as possible with blotting-paper,
and afterwards is moderately
warmed.</p>

<p><i>Alcohol</i> ought to be very pure and well rectified.
It is necessary to colour it, because,
being colourless of itself, it could not be seen
in capillary tubes. To colour alcohol, you infuse
carmine in it, and, after some time, decant
or filter the clear solution. The liquid should
be perfectly transparent, and free from all extraneous
substances. It is not proper to employ
alcohol in the construction of standard
thermometers; mercury being much preferable.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric Acid.</i>&mdash;It is made use of for the
differential thermometer, and the thermoscope
of Rumford. It has the advantage of being
lighter than mercury, and very slightly volatile:
these two qualities, joined to its tendency to
absorb the vapour of water, render it very
proper to be employed for various instruments.
It must be very concentrated, and tinged red
by carmine.</p>

<p><i>Ether.</i>&mdash;Sulphuric and nitric ether, with
which some small instruments are filled, are
merely employed to shew with what facility
these liquids are brought to their boiling point.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="OF_GRADUATION_IN_GENERAL" class="smcap">Of Graduation in general.</span>&mdash;Graduation,
generally speaking, consists in dividing lines,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
surfaces, and capacities, into a certain number
of equal or proportional parts. It is not our
intention to treat here of the methods furnished
by practical geometry for effecting such divisions
with mathematical accuracy; these
methods are known to every body. We shall
confine ourselves to describing the processes of
graduation which are peculiar to the instruments
constructed by the glass-blower.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="EXAMINATION_OF_THE_BORE_OF_TUBES" class="smcap">Examination of the Bore of Tubes.</span>&mdash;We
have already observed, that, for standard
thermometers and other instruments which require
to be made very accurate, it is necessary
to employ tubes which are extremely regular in
the bore. When a drop of mercury, passed
successively along all parts of the tube, forms
everywhere a column of the same length, the
examiner is assured of the goodness of the
tube.</p>

<p>That a tube may be regular in the bore, it is
not necessary that the bore be cylindrical; it
is sufficiently accurate when equal lengths correspond
to equal capacities. A tube with a flat
canal, for example, can be perfectly accurate
without at all approaching the cylindrical form.
It is only necessary that a drop of mercury occupy
everywhere the same length. We may
observe, by,the way, that, in flat canals, the
flattening should be always in the same plane.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="DIVISION_OF_CAPILLARY_TUBES_INTO_PARTS_OF_EQUAL_CAPACITY" class="smcap">Division of Capillary Tubes into parts
of equal capacity.</span>&mdash;As it is very difficult to
meet with capillary tubes which are exactly regular
in the bore, it happens that the tubes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
which glass-blowers are obliged to employ have
different capacities in parts of equal length.
You commence the division of these tubes into
parts of equal capacity by a process described
by M. Gay-Lussac. You introduce a quantity
of mercury, sufficient to fill rather more than
half the tube, and make a mark at the extremity
of the column. You then pass the mercury
to the other end of the tube, and again
mark the extremity of the column. If you so
manage that the distance between the two
marks is very small, you may consider the enclosed
space as concentric, and a mark made
in the middle of the division will divide the
tube into two parts of evidently equal capacity.
You divide one of these parts, by the same
process, into two equal capacities, and each of
these into two others; and in this manner you
continue to graduate the tube until you have
pushed the division as far as you judge proper.</p>

<p>But it is still more simple to introduce a drop
of mercury into the tube, so as to form a little
cylinder, and then to mark the two extremities
of the cylinder. If it were possible to push
the drop of mercury from one end of the tube
to the other, in such a manner as to make it
coincide, at every removal, with the last mark,
it would be very easy to divide the tube accurately;
but as it is very difficult, not to say
impossible, to attain this precision of result in
moving the column of mercury, you must endeavour
to approach exactness as nigh as may
be. You measure, every time you move the
mercury, the length of the cylinder it produces,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
and carry this length to the last mark, presuming
the small space which is found between
the mark and the commencement of the column
to be fairly represented by the same space after
the column. You thus obtain a series of small
and corresponding capacities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_GAS_JARS_TEST_TUBES" class="smcap">Graduation of Gas Jars, Test Tubes, &amp;c.</span>&mdash;If
the tube is regular in the bore, close one
end, either by sealing it at the lamp, or by inserting
a cork, and pour into the interior two
or three small and equal portions of mercury,
in order to have an opportunity of observing
the irregularities produced by the sealed part.
Take care to mark, with a writing diamond,
the height of the mercury, after the addition of
each portion. When equal portions of mercury
are perceived to fill equal spaces, take
with the compass the length of the last portion,
and mark it successively along the side of the
tube, where you must previously trace a line
parallel to its axis.</p>

<p>For tubes which are irregular in the bore,
and where equal lengths indicate unequal capacities,
it is necessary to continue the graduation
in the same manner that you commenced
it&mdash;that is to say, to fill the tubes by adding
successively many small and equal portions of
mercury, and marking the height of the metallic
column after every addition. These divisions
will of course represent parts of an
ounce or of a cubic inch according to the measure
which you make use of. When you have
thus traced on the tube a certain number of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
equal parts, you can, by means of the compasses,
divide each of them into two other
parts of equal length. The first divisions being
very close to one another, the small portion of
tube between every two may be considered
without much risk of error as being sensibly of
equal diameter in its whole extent.</p>

<p>When the tube which you desire to graduate
is long and has thin sides, it would be difficult
to fill it with mercury without running the risk
of seeing it break under the weight of the
metal. In this case, you must use water instead
of mercury.</p>

<p>Bell-glasses of large dimensions are graduated
by filling them with water, placing them in
an inverted position on a smooth and horizontal
surface, which is slightly covered with water,
and passing under them a series of equal measures
of air. But it is then necessary to
operate constantly at the same temperature
and under the same atmospheric pressure, because
air is very elastic and capable of being
greatly expanded.</p>

<p>In all cases, tubes, bell-glasses, &amp;c. ought
to be held in a position perfectly vertical. The
most convenient measure is a dropping-tube,
on the stalk of which a mark has been made,
or a small piece of tube, sealed at one end, and
ground flat at the other; the latter can be accurately
closed by a plate of glass.</p>

<p>The marks which are traced on tubes being
generally very close to one another, you facilitate
the reading of the scale by giving a greater
length to those marks which represent every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
fifth division, and by writing the figures merely
to every tenth division. See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 8. The
number of divisions is somewhat arbitrary;
nevertheless, 100, 120, 360, 1000, are divisions
which, in practice, offer most advantages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_HYDROMETERS" class="smcap">Graduation of Hydrometers.</span>&mdash;Cut a
band of paper on which the graduation of the
instrument can be traced, and let fall upon it a
little drop of sealing-wax; then roll the paper
upon a little glass tube, and introduce it into
the stalk of the hydrometer. The instrument
is afterwards to be plunged into distilled water,
which is carefully kept at the temperature of
40° F. above zero. Give the instrument sufficient
ballast to make it sink till the point
(<i>a</i>, <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 20,) which you desire to make to
represent the density of water, touches the
surface of the water. Mark this point with
much precision; it is the zero of the instrument.
The other degrees are taken by plunging
the hydrometer into distilled water to which
you have added 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. <i>tenths</i>, or
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. <i>hundredths</i>, of the substance
for which you wish to construct the hydrometer,
according as you desire the scale to indicate
tenths or hundredths.</p>

<p>When you have thus marked the degrees on
the stalk of the instrument, transfer them to
the paper with the help of the compasses. The
scale being completed, replace it in the tube of
the hydrometer, where it must be fixed; in so
doing, take care to make the degrees on the
scale coincide precisely with those marked on
the stalk.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>You can thus procure hydrometers for
alcohol, acids, salts, &amp;c. which are instruments
that indicate the <i>proportion</i> of alcohol,
acid, salt, &amp;c. contained in a given mass of
water.</p>

<p>But if it were necessary to plunge the hydrometer
in a hundred different solutions in
order to produce the scale, it is easy to conceive
that that would be extremely troublesome,
especially for hydrometers which are employed
in commerce, and which do not need to be so
extremely accurate. When the density of the
mixtures or solutions is a mean between those
of the substances which enter into them, you
may content yourself with marking the zero
and one other fixed point, (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 20.)
Then, as the stalk of the hydrometer is evidently
of equal diameter in all its extent, you can divide
the space which separates the two fixed
points into a certain number of equal parts.
One of these, being taken for unity, represents
a particular quantity of the substance which
you have added to a determined weight of distilled
water. By means of this unity you can
carry the scale up and down the stalk of the
instrument. It is thus, that, to obtain a Baumé’s
hydrometer, after having obtained the zero by
immersion in distilled water, you plunge the
instrument into a solution containing a hundred
parts of water and fifteen of common salt, to
have the 15th degree, or containing a hundred
water and thirty salt, to have the 30th degree.
Upon dividing the interval into fifteen or thirty
equal parts, according as you have employed
one or the other solution, you obtain the value
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
of the degree, which you can carry upwards
or downwards as far as you wish.</p>

<p>Among the substances for which hydrometers
are required in commerce, are some which it is
impossible to obtain free from water&mdash;such are
alcohol, the acids, &amp;c. In this case it is necessary
to employ the substances in their purest
state, and deprived of as much water as
possible.</p>

<p>The employment of hydrometers is very extensive:
they are used to estimate the strength
of lyes, of soap solutions, of wines, milk, &amp;c.
There is, in short, no branch of commerce in
which these instruments are not required for
the purpose of ascertaining the goodness of
the articles which are bought and sold. The
employment of hydrometers would be still
more general, if they could be made to give
immediately the absolute specific gravity of
the liquids into which they might be plunged,
the specific gravity of water being considered
as unity. It is possible to graduate a thermometer
of this description by proceeding as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Make choice of a hydrometer of which the
exterior part of the stalk is very regular. Introduce
the band of paper on which the scale
is to be written, and then ballast the instrument.
Make a mark where the surface of the
distilled water touches the stalk. Remove the
hydrometer from the water, wipe it perfectly
dry, and weigh it very accurately with a sensible
balance. Then pour into it a quantity of
mercury equal to its own weight; plunge it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
again into the water, and again mark the point
where the stalk touches the surface of the
water. Pour the mercury out of the instrument,
transfer the two marks to the scale, and
divide this fixed distance into fifty equal parts.
Having by this operation obtained the value of
the degree, you carry it upwards and downwards,
to augment the scale. If you take the
first point near the reservoir, the hydrometer
will be proper to indicate the density of liquids
which are heavier than water; if you
take it towards the middle of the tube, the contrary
will be the case.</p>

<p>If you destine the hydrometer for liquids
much heavier than water&mdash;such as acids, for
example&mdash;you might, after having determined
the first point, add to the original ballast as
much mercury as is equal to the weight of the
whole instrument; then the point where the
stalk would touch the surface of the water, and
which would be represented by 100, would be
very high, and the second point, which would
be found below, would be represented by 200.
On dividing the space into a hundred equal
parts, you would have the value of the degree,
which could be carried up and down for the
extension of the scale.</p>

<p>The specific gravities being in the inverse
ratio of the volumes plunged into the liquid,
the numbers of the scale which mark the specific
gravities diminish from below; so that, on
marking the lowest point 100, you have, on
proceeding upwards, the successive degrees
0·99, 0·98, 0·97, 0·96, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>The hydrometers with two, three, and four
branches, are graduated by having their tubes
divided into a hundred or a thousand equal
parts. The divisions on each branch must
correspond with those on the other branches.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_BAROMETERS" class="smcap">Graduation of Barometers.</span>&mdash;The graduation
of this instrument consists in dividing a
piece of metal, wood, or ivory, into inches and
parts of inches. The divided rod is then employed
to measure the height of the mercury in
the tube. As the rule is moveable, the operation
presents no sort of difficulty: all that is
necessary is to make the zero of the scale coincide
with the inferior level of the mercury; the
point which corresponds with the superior level
of the mercury, seen in the tube, indicates the
height of the barometric column. It is in this
manner that the cistern barometer is graduated.</p>

<p>But if the barometer is one of those in which
the surface of the mercury is variable, such as
the barometer of Gay-Lussac, it is necessary
to have recourse to a different process of graduation.
If the two branches of the instrument
are very regular, and of equal diameter,
you first measure with precision the height of
the column of mercury, then divide it in the
middle, and fix the scale, which must be graduated
in such a manner that the mark of fifteen
inches corresponds exactly with the middle
point. This mode of graduation serves to indicate
merely the apparent height of the barometric
column. If you desire that the scale
should immediately indicate the real height, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
must fix the zero at the middle of the column,
and then double the figure which marks each
degree.</p>

<p>When you do not wish to write the real
height, you make two divisions, of which one
proceeds upwards, the other downwards. You
do not, in this case, double the value of each
division, but in observations made with such a
barometer scale you add the degree marked by
the two surfaces, in order to find the real height.</p>

<p>It is in an analogous manner that you graduate
the gauges or short barometers which are
employed to measure the density of air under
the recipient of the air-pump. You take the
height of the mercury in the gauge, and fix at
the middle of the column the zero of a double
scale, of which one division proceeds upwards,
the other downwards; or, instead of this, if
you choose to have only one scale, and that an
ascending scale, you double the value of every
degree.</p>

<p>The zero of the barometric scale can be
fixed below the inferior surface of the mercury;
but then, to have the real height, it is necessary
to measure precisely the height of the mercury
in the two branches of the instrument, and to
deduct the smaller from the larger.</p>

<p><i>Dial (or Wheel) Barometer.</i>&mdash;The disposition
which should be given to this instrument
is precisely the same as that of the <i>Dial Thermometer</i>,
described in a preceding section.
You make a small iron weight float on the inferior
surface of the mercury, and fix to this
weight a silk thread, which is stretched by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
counterpoise, and rolls over a very moveable
pulley. The axis of this pulley carries a needle,
which turns backwards or forwards according
as the column of mercury augments or diminishes.
You arrange the whole in such a
manner that the extreme variations of this column
cannot make the needle describe more
than one circumference; with this view you
give the pulley a diameter of nearly an inch.</p>

<p>The dial barometer being rather an object of
luxury than an instrument of precision, you graduate
it by inscribing the following words, at
full length, on the scale. In <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 16, for
example, you write,</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_THE_MANOMETER" class="smcap">Graduation of the Manometer.</span>&mdash;The
graduation of this instrument consists in
dividing the tube where the air is to be compressed,
into a given number of parts of equal
capacity; but as, in general, such tubes are
employed as are nearly capillary and very regular,
the operation is reduced to a linear division,
where every degree occupies an equal space.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_THERMOMETERS" class="smcap">Graduation of Thermometers.</span> <i>Construction
of Standard Thermometers.</i>&mdash;Having
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
constructed your instrument with a very regular
tube, or one which has been divided into
parts of equal capacity, and having filled it with
the proper liquid, according to the instructions
given in a preceding section, the graduation is
to be effected as follows. Procure very pure
ice, break it into small pieces, and fill a vessel
with it. When the ice begins to melt, plunge
the thermometer into the middle of it, in such
a manner that, without touching the sides
of the vessel, the whole thermometer, or at
least that part of it which contains the liquid,
may be covered with ice. Allow the instrument
to remain in this state until, in spite of
the gradual melting of the ice, the surface of
the column of liquid remains at a fixed point,
and neither falls nor rises. Mark this point
very carefully on the stalk of the thermometer,
either with a thread or a little drop of sealing-wax,
or with the trace of a diamond or a flint.
This is the <i>freezing point</i>, the <i>zero</i> of the centigrade
scale, the thirty-second degree of
Fahrenheit’s scale.</p>

<p>As for the second fixed point, it is marked
during an experiment with boiling water, performed
as follows:&mdash;You employ a vessel of
tin plate sufficiently high to enclose the whole
thermometer; you pour into this vessel distilled
water, till it is about an inch deep, and then
you heat it. The vessel is surmounted by a
cover pierced with two holes, one of which is
intended to receive the stalk of the thermometer,
the other to allow the steam to escape.
When, on continuing the ebullition, you observe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
that the mercury ceases to rise in the tube,
you mark the point at which it has stopped,
just as you marked the first point. The last
mark indicates the <i>boiling point</i>; the one hundredth
degree of the centigrade scale, the two
hundred and twelfth degree of Fahrenheit’s
scale. You transfer to paper the distance
which is found between the first point and the
second point determined, and you divide this
distance into one hundred equal parts, or degrees,
for the centigrade thermometer, into
eighty parts for the thermometer of Réaumur,
and into one hundred and eighty for that of
Fahrenheit. If the tube of the instrument is
very regular in the bore, the degrees should be
equal in length; if, on the contrary, you have
been obliged to divide it into parts of equal
capacity, you find how many of these parts or
little spaces it is necessary to take to constitute
one of the above degrees. You find this
by dividing their whole number by 100, or 80,
or 180, according to the degrees of the scale
which you intend to make use of. Thus, if
you find between the two points fixed by melting
ice and boiling water, three hundred divisions
of equal capacity, it is necessary to include
<i>three</i> of these divisions in every <i>degree</i>
of the centigrade scale.</p>

<p>The vessel employed to take the boiling
point must be of metal, and its surface should
be perfectly clean and well polished, and have
no rough points. If sand, or other matters,
were permitted to repose on the vessel, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
form asperities, the water would enter into
ebullition at an inferior temperature.</p>

<p>This operation should, moreover, be performed
under an atmospherical pressure, which
is indicated by the barometer when the mercury
stands at twenty-nine inches and a half. But
as this pressure is different according to the
elevation of the place of operation, and, indeed,
suffers continual variations even in the same
place, it follows that the temperature of boiling
water is subject to continual changes, and that,
in the graduation of the thermometer, it is indispensably
necessary to take notice of the
height of the barometer at the very moment
that the point denoting the degree of boiling-water
is fixed upon. You succeed in making
the necessary corrections by the help of the
following table, which is founded on the experiments
of Sir G. Shuckburg and of the
Committee of the Royal Society.</p>

<p><i>Common Thermometers.</i>&mdash;Having, by the
method which we have just described, obtained
a <i>Standard Thermometer</i>, you may procure
with facility as many ordinary thermometers as
you desire. It is proper to employ the most
regular tubes which you can obtain, and when
the instruments are ready to be graduated, you
must bring them into comparison with your
standard thermometer. You place them together
into a liquid of which you gradually raise
the temperature, and you mark several points
on the scale of the new thermometer, the intervals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
between which are subsequently divided
into as many degrees as are marked on the scale
of the standard thermometer. Thus, for example,
you mark the 10° and 15°, and afterwards
divide the interval into five equal parts. This
gives you the length of a degree on the stalk
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of the new instrument. The more you multiply
these fixed points, the more you insure the
precision of the thermometer. When you have
taken a certain number of points, you measure
the remainder with the compasses.</p>

<p>The zero, 0°, of the thermometer of Fahrenheit,
is taken by means of a mixture of snow
and common salt, and its maximum point is,
like that of the preceding thermometer, taken
by means of boiling water; but this interval is
divided into 212 degrees; so that the scale
marks 32° where the centigrade and Réaumur’s
scales mark 0°.</p>

<p>The thermometer of Delisle has but one
fixed point, which is the heat of boiling water;
this is the zero of the instrument. The inferior
degrees are 0,0001 (one ten-thousandth
part) of the capacity of the bulb and stalk of
the thermometer. It marks 150° at 0° of the
centigrade, or 32° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer.</p>

<p>The dial, the maximum and the minimum
thermometers, are graduated according to the
same principles as the common thermometers.</p>

<p>You can, with a mercurial thermometer, make
the centigrade scale rise to 300 or 400 degrees
above zero; but with an alcohol thermometer,
you must never go beyond the heat of boiling
water. On the contrary, the inferior degrees
of the alcohol thermometer can be carried to
the very lowest point, while those of the mercurial
thermometer should be stopped at thirty
or thirty-five degrees below the zero of the centigrade
scale, as the mercury then approaches very
near the point of its congelation. In all cases,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the degrees of thermometer scales are indicated
by the sign - when they are below zero, and
by the sign + when they are above it; the -
is always marked, but the + generally omitted.
See <a href="#pl_4">pl. 4</a>, fig. 6.</p>

<p>We may observe here that it is proper from
time to time to plunge the standard thermometer
into melting ice, for the purpose of verifying
its exactness. It has been found that
thermometers constructed with a vacuum above
the column of mercury gradually become inaccurate,
the 0° ascending, until it corresponds
with + 1° or + 2°. This singular effect is
attributable to the constant pressure of the atmosphere,
which, being supported merely by
the resistance of the very thin sides of the
thermometer, finally presses them together, and
diminishes the capacity of the reservoir. It is
partly for the sake of avoiding this inconvenience
that we consider it good not to make an
entire vacuum above the mercury, but to leave
a portion of air in the tube, and at the same
time to form a little reservoir at the summit of
the instrument.</p>

<p><i>Differential Thermometer.</i>&mdash;To graduate
this instrument, you first maintain the two
bulbs at an equal temperature, by which you
determine the first fixed point, which is zero.
Then, enveloping one of the two bulbs with
melting snow, and elevating the other by
means of a vessel with warm water, to a known
temperature&mdash;to 20° Centigrade, for example&mdash;you
fix a certain space, which you afterwards
divide into 20 equal parts or degrees. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
scale is continued by carrying successively to
each side the known value of a degree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_RUMFORDS_THERMOSCOPE" class="smcap">Graduation of Rumford’s Thermoscope.</span>&mdash;This
instrument is graduated by dividing the
tube which separates the two bulbs into equal
parts, the number of which is arbitrary, though,
in general, the thermoscope tube is divided into
nine or eleven parts. There is always an odd
number of degrees, and you manage so that
the odd degree is found in the middle of the
tube. It carries the mark of zero at each end,
and the figures 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. proceed from each
end of this middle degree, and form two corresponding
scales.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span id="GRADUATION_OF_MARIOTTES_TUBE" class="smcap">Graduation of Mariotte’s Tube.</span>&mdash;You
divide the little branch which is sealed at the
end into a certain number of parts of equal
capacity, and the large branch into inches and
parts of inches. It is necessary to take care
that the zero of the two ascending scales correspond,
and are situated above the inferior
bend formed by the two branches of the instrument.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
